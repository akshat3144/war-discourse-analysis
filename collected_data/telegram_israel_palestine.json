    "text": "⭕ أبو عبيدة:  وفي المقابل، تلقى العدو ولا يزال جوابه من مجاهدينا ومقاومتنا في رفح قتلاً لجنوده وتدميراً لآلياته وكمائن لقواته، وبالتوازي، فإنه يتلقى الضربات الموجعة في كل مكان يتوغل فيه من جديد، في محور وسط القطاع، المسمى نيتساريم، الذي سيكون محورًا للموت والرعب بإذن الله لجنود العدو المحتلين، وسيخرج منه العدو مندحرًا كما خرج من قبل بقوة الله تعالى.\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: إن قدرة مجاهدينا على القتال والصمود وإرادتهم لمواجهة هذا العدو باتت أكبر وأعظم بفضل الله، وإن نار الانتقام التي أشعلها العدو بجرائمه ونازيته وساديته كافية لحرقه وتدمير كل مخططاته بإذن الله. \n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: سينشأ جيل فولاذي معبأ بإرادة المقاومة والقتال والتصدي للعدو، وهذا أكبر إخفاق استراتيجي للعدو سيدركه بعد حين.\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: نؤكد أن القدرات البشرية لكتائب القسام بخير كبير بفضل الله تعالى، وقد تمكنا بعون الله خلال الحرب من تجنيد الآلاف من المجاهدين الجدد من صفوف الإسناد، وهناك آلاف آخرون مستعدون وبدافع كبير للالتحاق متى لزم الأمر.\n\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: تمكن مجاهدونا بفضل الله من إعادة تأهيل وترميم بعض المقدرات  المهمة وتجهيز الأفخاخ والكمائن وتصنيع العبوات والقذائف، وإعادة تدوير عدد كبير من مخلفات العدو من قنابل ومتفجرات وصواريخ ألقاها العدو على أهلنا المدنيين بكثافة عالية جدًا وغير مسبوقة في تاريخ الحروب.\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة:  فقد عززنا المقدرات الدفاعية لمواجهة الاحتلال في كل مكان يتواجد فيه على أرضنا، ولا يزال لدينا الكثير لنقوله للعدو بإذن الله تعالى،  \"لِيَمْكُرُواْ فِيهَا ۖ وَمَا يَمْكُرُونَ إِلَّا بِأَنفُسِهِمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ\". \n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: رسالتنا لجمهور العدو ولعائلات الجنود الصهاينة في غزة ولعائلات أسرى العدو، أنه بات معلومًا لديكم ولكل العالم أن النصر المطلق الذي يتحدث عنه نتنياهو هو انتصاره الشخصي في إقصاء خصومه وبقائه في السلطة في مقابل التضحية بأبنائكم. \n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: وبالتالي فإن مصير أبنائكم يا جمهور العدو أصبح لعبة في يد رئيس حكومتكم ووزراء حكومته الصعاليك المهووسين بالتدمير والقتل، وأن كل ما يفعله نتنياهو هو محاولة للهروب من الحقيقة والإخفاق الذي سيلاحقه بقية حياته.\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: ما كشف عنه مؤخرًا في أوساط العدو من وثائق استخبارية حول الفشل المدوي في السابع من أكتوبر هو أمر هين بالمقارنة مع ما سنكشف عنه في الوقت المناسب بإذن الله من وثائق ستكون أقسى وأصعب، تظهر كيف استطعنا تنفيذ خداع استراتيجي مركب لجهاز الشاباك والمنظومة الأمنية للعدو لسنوات.\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: إن ما يجري من تصاعد مستمر لعمليات المقاومة في الضفة المحتلة في جنين وفي نابلس جبل النار، وفي كل محافظات الضفة والقدس المحتلة، هو رد وخيار شعبنا في مواجهة الإبادة الممنهجة والتهويد والاستيطان الذي تنفذه حكومة العدوان والإجرام. \n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: وإن هذا الرد وهذه العمليات المباركة والنوعية لكافة فصائل المقاومة هو ما يليق بشعبنا المرابط الأبي، وهي أكبر رسالة لهذا العدو المتغطرس ولوزراء حكومته النازية، أن كابوس تحرك الضفة والقدس والخلايا الثائرة من الأرض المحتلة عام 48 قادم لا محالة، وبشكل لا يتوقعه العدو بإذن الله تعالى. \n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: كل التحية لأبطال ضفتنا، وندعوهم لمواصلة سحق كبرياء هذا العدو المرتعد، ومواصلة عملياتهم وتصعيدها، فهم محط الآمال، وهم أهم حلقة في نهاية حلم هذا الكيان الغاصب.\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: تحية واجبة نوجهها لإخواننا المقاومين الأبطال في حزب الله في لبنان الشقيق، ولمجاهدي الفصائل الفلسطينية والجماعة الإسلامية في لبنان ولشهدائهم، ولإخواننا أنصار الله في اليمن العظيم، وللمقاومة العراقية الحرة، والذين أبلغونا جميعًا باستمرار الإسناد الفعال والرفع المتواصل لسقف الرد حتى يتوقف العدوان على غزة.\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: لقد لقنوا العدو دروسًا قاسية، وأعادوا للأمة أمل الوحدة في وجه العدوان والقدرة على حصاره وتركيعه، وأشعروه بأنه كيان غريب منبوذ بعد أن توحدت هذه الجبهات في نصرة القدس وغزة وفلسطين بالقول والفعل والقتال وبذل الدماء وشحذ السلاح وفرض التهجير على العدو، وحصاره بحرًا واختراق أجوائه وإرباك منظوماته الاستخبارية والأمنية\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: إن ضمير أمتنا الجمعي بالتأكيد ينحاز لهذه المقاومة التي نصرت غزة بإرادة فولاذية وقتال بلا هوادة، فقد سئمت شعوب أمتنا التضامن اللفظي الخجول والعجز الرسمي المقيت.\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: لقد حقق مقاتلو أمتنا الأوفياء مفهوم النصرة والوحدة العربية كما لم يحدث من قبل، فما أسعد روح شهيدنا عبد القادر الحسيني بكم يا أبطال أمتنا، وما أشد خيبة أمله من زعماء ناشدهم رحمه الله منذ 76 عامًا، ولا زال صدى صوته لا يحرك فيهم ساكنًا، بل إن عجزهم بات أكبر، وتقاعسهم وخذلانهم أصبح أشد وأقسى.",

    "text": "*أبرز ما جاء في كلمة الناطق باسم كتائب الشهيد عز الدين القسام أبو عبيدة اليوم الأحد:*\n\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: 9 شهور مضت منذ بدء معركة طوفان الأقصى في السابع من أكتوبر من العام الماضي، ولا يزال شعبنا يتعرض للعدوان النازي الصهيو أمريكي والإبادة الجماعية كعقاب له على تمسكه بأرضه ومقدساته وممارسته لحقه الطبيعي، بل واجبه في المقاومة لاسترداد حقوقه وطرد محتليه.\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: 9 أشهر نذكر بعدها العالم أن طوفان الأقصى لم يكن بداية التاريخ لعملنا المقاوم ولا لعدوان الاحتلال، بل مثل الانفجار في وجه العدو لما سبقه من عقود قهر وظلم وطغيان من عصابات الصهيونية تجاه البشر والحجر والشجر والأرض والمقدسات.\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: بلغت ذروة العدوان مع حكومة صهيونية يراها العالم اليوم تجاهر بعدم الاعتراف حتى بوجود شعب فلسطيني، وتمارس التطهير والإبادة الممنهجة في الضفة والقدس وفي غزة، وتحرض على الوجود الفلسطيني داخل فلسطين المحتلة عام 48. \n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: إن فهم شعبنا لطبيعة هذه المعركة وعملية طوفان الأقصى هو ما تعكسه استطلاعات الرأي المستقلة التي أظهرت بعد شهور طويلة من العدوان كيف أن شعبنا في غزة والضفة يؤيد بشكل كاسح عملية طوفان الأقصى ويلتف حول مقاومته. \n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: 9 أشهر وما كلت مقاومتنا ولا لانت ولا استكانت، إذ لا زلنا نقاتل في غزة بلا دعم ولا إمداد خارجي بالسلاح والعتاد، ولا زال شعبنا يصمد بلا غذاء ولا ماء ولا دواء وتحت حرب إبادة مجرمة ظالمة.\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: تدخل غزة التاريخ من أوسع أبواب المجد كأعظم نموذج حرية عرفته البشرية في العصر الحديث وكمدرسة ملهمة لكل حر ومقاوم وإنسان في العالم.\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: يا أهلنا، يا شعبنا، يا أمتنا، يا كل أحرار العالم، يقاتل مجاهدو شعبنا ومقاوموه قتالاً ملحمياً منذ تسعة شهور، ويثخنون في أهداف العدو ويقهرون جيشه المدجج بالسلاح والعتاد والمغطى بالنار من البر والبحر والجو والمدعوم من الولايات المتحدة وبريطانيا شركاء العدوان والإبادة.\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: يقاتل مجاهدونا ببسالة ويخرجون للعدو كما توعدناه من اليوم الأول للعدوان، فيقتلون ويصيبون جنوده في كل يوم رغم طول أمد المعركة وبشاعة العدوان، ورغم أننا نقاتل الجيش الأكثر نذالة ودناءة ولا أخلاقية في العالم. \n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: جيش يستخدم المدنيين دروعا بشرية ويوهمهم بمناطق آمنة ثم يقصفهم فيها، ويقصف البيوت المدنية على رؤوس ساكنيها، ويستبيح المشافي والمنظمات الدولية والمدارس ومراكز الإيواء المدنية ويتعمد تدمير الآثار والمناطق التاريخية والمساجد والكنائس والمقابر والمكتبات لأنه يخاف من التاريخ الذي يخبره أنه لا مستقبل للغزاة وأنه سيذهب إلى مزابل التاريخ.\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: كل هذا يحدث على مرأى ومسمع من العالم وعلى شاشات البث المباشر ليرى العالم من خلال غزة أكذوبة المنظمات الدولية وعجز قوانين حقوق الإنسان المزعومة وعوار العدالة الدولية الانتقائية.\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: مجاهدونا يقاتلون بكل صلابة ويبتدعون الوسائل والتكتيكات ويواجهون العدو بروح قتالية عظيمة وبإيمان منقطع النظير كأنهم من زمن صحابة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، ويجري الله على أيديهم من الكرامات والثبات ما يعجز اللسان عن وصفه، وصدق الله العظيم: \"والذين جاهدوا فينا لنهدينهم سبلنا وإن الله لمع المحسنين\".\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: على مدار 9 أشهر كاملة، بفضل الله تعالى، قاتلت كل كتائبنا الأربع والعشرين وكل أسلحة الدعم القتالي من أقصى بيت حانون شمالاً إلى أقصى رفح جنوباً، ومعنا فصائل المقاومة إخوة ورفاق السلاح والجهاد.\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: خاضت كتائبنا ملاحم وجولات متتالية ولا تزال، فكان أداء مجاهدينا في كل مرة يتقدم ويتطور ويتعاظم، بل يثخن مجاهدونا الجراح في العدو أكثر، ويستفيدون من تجاربهم في كل مرة، وقد قدمنا الشهداء الأبرار من الجنود والقادة من كافة المستويات، لكن الراية لا تسقط ولن تسقط بإذن الله تعالى وعونه. \n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: ها هم مجاهدونا يقولون للعدو في كل يوم: \"لا مقام لكم في غزة الأبية، لا لناقلة النمر ولا لجنود مرتزقين مجهزين بأحدث تكنولوجيا حربية، ولا لمرتزقة يقاتلون بالأجرة في معركة خاسرة، ولا لقوات تتحصن في البيوت كاللصوص، ولا لضباط يختبئون خلف المدرعات، كلهم سيرحل قتيلاً أو مصاباً أو هارباً مذعوراً بإذن الله تعالى\".\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة:  معركة رفح الجارية منذ نحو شهرين والتي يقدم فيها مجاهدونا بكل بسالة، وما يسطره مجاهدونا أيضاً منذ نحو أسبوعين في الشجاعية، وما رافق هذه العمليات من معارك مشتعلة في شمال القطاع ووسطه وجنوبه، فهو أكبر دليل على بأس مقاومتنا وعنفوانها وعلى فشل العدو وتخبطه.\n\n⭕ أبو عبيدة: كل العالم يشهد خداع المجرم الفاسد نتنياهو ووزير حربه، فقد كانوا يمنون جمهورهم ويخدعون العالم بأن معركة رفح هي الضربة القاضية وهي المحطة الفاصلة، فلم تكن معركة رفح سوى استكمال من العدو لسياسة التدمير الممنهج والمجازر ضد المدنيين.",

Enkele richtlijnen voor de acties de komende dagen, met name aanstaande zondag om 14.00 uur in Schuman:` \n \n1) We proberen onze verdriet en woede op een constructieve manier om te zetten in ongeziene burgerkracht: **het kamp van vrede, liefde, solidariteit en menselijkheid, dat zijn wij! **🕊 \n \n2) Ons doel is om mensen van ALLE achtergronden samen te brengen die in een meer humane wereld willen leven. **Laten we daarom leuzen gebruiken in talen die de meerderheid hier in België begrijpt (FR, NL, EN) en zonder religieuze connotatie. **Dit is niet alleen de strijd van één religie, maar de strijd van de hele mensheid. 🤝 \n \n3) Het verzet tegen de onrechtvaardigheden die dit volk al 75 jaar ondergaat, mag op geen enkele manier leiden tot passieve of actieve: Essentialisering van de joodse gemeenschap met het Israëlische beleid; Vereenvoudigingen tussen de Israëlische samenleving en de Israëlische regering; Antisemitische boodschappen, daden en toespraken. Dit alles is onaanvaardbaar en zal altijd afbreuk doen aan de vooruitzichten op eenheid met allen die solidair kunnen zijn met deze zaak. **Er zijn veel Joden die de Palestijnse zaak steunen, en we moeten hen beschermen en met liefde omringen. **👏 \n \n4) Zondag, **laten we allemaal een actieve rol spelen om ervoor te zorgen dat iedereen gedisciplineerd blijft en dat er geen incidenten zijn. **Elke vorm van misdraging tijdens de manifestatie zal tegen ons en onze zaak worden gebruikt! 💪 \n \n5)** Deel dit telegramkanaal en de visuals voor de manifestatie van zondag (14.00 uur Schuman) in GROTE getale! 🔥🔥🔥**",

Tout ceci n’est pas acceptable et desservira toujours les perspectives d’union avec tous ceux qui pourraient être solidaires de cette cause.** Il y a de nombreux juifs qui soutiennent la cause palestinienne et nous devons les protéger et les couvrir d’amour.** 👏 \n \n4) Dimanche, **jouons tous un rôle actif pour faire en sorte que tout le monde reste discipliné et qu’il n’y ait pas d’incidents. **Tout débordement à la manifestation sera utilisé contre nous et contre notre cause ! 💪 \n \n5) **Partagez ce canal telegram et les visuels de la manif de dimanche (14h Schuman) en MASSE ! **🔥🔥🔥",

    "text": "Hallo allemaal,\n\nIk neem aan dat jullie het vreselijke nieuws hebben gezien van de bombardementen op het ziekenhuis in Gaza, en op de school (gerund door de VN) die in de buurt als schuilplaats werd gebruikt 😞\n\nMet de aanslag van gisteren in Brussel is het moreel nog lager. Maar we gaan ons verdriet omzetten in strijd ✊\n\nWe houden je hier op de hoogte van de acties. De \"Boycot Axa\" actie van vrijdag moest worden afgelast na onderhandelingen met de politie.\n\nDe demonstratie van morgen in Leuven gaat wel door, op het Martelarenplein om 17.30 uur, dus vertel het verder!\n\nDe demonstratie van zondag blijft een prioriteit. Alle nieuwe informatie zal hier worden doorgegeven.\n\nWat de aanslag van gisteren betreft: vertel je omgeving dat deze crimineel zei NIETS met Palestina te maken te hebben, en dat Islamitische Staat een groep is die niets te maken heeft met Hamas (en in feite een tegenstander op het terrein is). Laten we deze verwarring niet laten verspreiden.\n\nBlijf de link delen https://t.me/PalestineSolidarityBelgium\n\nIk heb hier ook wat visuals geplaatst die je kunt gebruiken om het evenement onder de aandacht te brengen of om inhoud te delen.\n\nIk wens jullie veel sterkte ❤️",

Mais nous allons transformer notre peine en lutte!✊\n\nOn vous tient au courant ici des actions. L’action de vendredi “Boycott Axa” a dû être annulée après négociations avec la police.\n\nLe rassemblement DEMAIN à Leuven est par contre maintenu, à Martelarenplein 17h30, à faire tourner dans vos contacts!\n\nLa manifestation de dimanche est A PRIORI maintenue. Toute info nouvelle passera ici.\n\nQuand à l’attaque de hier: répétez autour de vous, ce criminel n’a RIEN revendiqué en rapport avec la Palestine, et l’Etat islamique est un groupe qui n’a rien à voir avec le Hamas (et même adversaires sur le terrain en réalité). Ne laissons pas passer l’amalgame.\n\nContinuez à partager le lien https://t.me/PalestineSolidarityBelgium\n\nJe mets aussi ici quelques visuels que vous pouvez utiliser pour diffuser les évènement, ou pour partager du contenu.\n\nForce à toutes et tous ❤️",

The content is deeply disturbing as it not only promotes violence but also dehumanizes the victims, exacerbating their suffering. Additionally, the channel contains speech and harassment targeting a particular religion, fostering intolerance and division among different communities.

Sebaliknya, mendukung Israel dan mendukung produk yang dukung Israel hukumnya haram.\n\nFatwa tersebut juga merekomendasikan agar pemerintah mengambil langkah-langkah tegas membantu perjuangan Palestina.\n\nKetua MUI Bidang Fatwa, Asrorun Niam Sholeh menegaskan, mendukung agresi Israel baik secara langsung maupun tidak langsung seperti membeli produk dari produsen yang secara nyata mendukung Israel haram hukumnya.\n\nSource: https://www.instagram.com/p/CzfyIx1LyIb/?igshid=MXV0MDRnMzMycnRnbw==",

    "text": "**Support Palestine. Boycott brands that support Israel.**\n\nTaking a stance to support the Palestinian population by boycotting products that have ties to Israel is a form of peaceful protest and solidarity. This approach involves conscientiously refraining from purchasing or using goods and services from companies that have significant financial or political connections to Israel. The idea behind this strategy is to exert economic pressure on entities that may indirectly or directly contribute to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While it's important to remember that individual consumer choices alone may not resolve the complex geopolitical issues at play, some individuals and organizations choose to engage in such boycotts as a way to raise awareness, express their political views, and advocate for change. It's worth noting that the effectiveness and ethical implications of such actions are subjects of debate, and people should consider the broader context and consequences of their choices.",

It is heartening to see people from various walks of life, regardless of their faith or nationality, come together in solidarity with the Palestinian people, seeking a fair and peaceful resolution to the long-standing conflict in the region. Therefore, I encourage you to join this global movement and extend your support to the people of Palestine, who have endured immense challenges for far too long.

This is the result and fruit of steadfastness, perseverance and great sacrifices during which our people offered their best sons, heroes and leaders as martyrs on the road to Jerusalem and Palestine.\n\n— This agreement, in its first stage, would not have been possible without the steadfastness of our people, their roots and their adherence to their land despite the brutality, killing, massacres and war of extermination and ethnic cleansing carried out by the Zionist enemy supported by the unjust American and Western decision, weapons and money.\n\n— The priority of the resistance was clear and fixed, which is to stop the aggression, return the displaced to their homes, provide urgent relief, a serious prisoner exchange deal and reconstruction.\n\n— As our people and their resistance were a model of patience and sacrifice, they will remain proud, lofty, steadfast and firm on their land. Neither wounds nor destroyed homes can weaken their resolve or break their will. Our people and their valiant, steadfast, confident resistance, believing in God's promise and victory, will remain a burning, blazing, rooted, and unwavering flame on the path to liberating Palestine from its sea to its river.\n\n— We salute our steadfast people, their heroic resistance fighters and their proud fighters who stood firm and patient in the field of confrontation and struggle, shattered the myth of the invincible army and trampled on the heads of its soldiers, officers and leaders in the revolutionary camp of Jabalia and Beit Hanoun, the legend, until \"Hanoun Jarad\" and all of northern Gaza, Khan Younis and its eastern part, Rafah, the middle, Gaza City and its neighborhoods became witnesses to the dawn of the new nation and the inability of the usurping entity to achieve its goals despite the great destruction and abundant sacrifices.\n\n— Peace be upon the souls of all the martyrs of our heroic people in Gaza, the West Bank, the occupied interior, and in the diaspora, and peace be upon the martyrs of Hezbollah, Ansar Allah, Jordan, and Iran, and peace be upon the souls of the leaders His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, Saleh al-Arouri, Abdul Aziz al-Minawi, Muhammad Abdul Aal, Raafat, Khaled Abu Hilal, Abbas Nilforoushan, Sayyed Hashem Safi al-Din, Fouad Shukr, Ibrahim Aqil, Ali Karaki, and all the leaders whose names will be engraved with a ray of light in the history books.\n\n— Greetings to all the great fronts and arenas of support, so greetings to the Islamic Resistance in Hezbollah and its great martyrs of leaders and soldiers, and to the heroes of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, and to the great Yemeni people and to the heroes of its armed forces, and to Islamic Iran, its people, army, and leadership, who were a support and backing for our people and our resistance.\n__\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

Then, the ~~Israeli~~ invasion of Gaza left no room for our dear people, who are saturated with the spirit of faith, to participate and support in fulfilling their responsibility towards an oppressed people who are being subjected to genocidal massacres before the eyes and ears of the entire world.__\n\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

So I decided to stop uploading corrected manuscripts after each chapter, and poured through the entire book from front to back until I got every type-o.\n\nFor those who bought prior editions, there is no worry, they are not super major errors that would warrant you needing to buy it again, we just want to  make sure we adhere to quality standards for future orders.\n\nOur book is available here and ships worldwide. https://basirapress.org/shop/books/firmest-handle-book/",

    "text": "**🐀 According to Yigal Levin, a former IOF reserve officer who served from 2005 to 2010, he stated on social media:\n\n****The locals who warmly welcomed the Israeli soldiers are not just random people. Throughout the civil war, Israel supported the rebels in southern Syria with humanitarian aid, medical assistance, evacuations, treatment of fighters in field hospitals, and even arms supplies, as well as occasional air support — sometimes, as they say, \"on special occasions.\" The delivery of humanitarian aid and medical treatment was openly and officially acknowledged long ago, several years back. However, arms supplies were a taboo topic, only discussed in whispers. Now, with Assad's regime no longer in power, such matters are spoken about freely. Moreover, it all happened six or more years ago. For the Israel Defense Forces, these people are not strangers, and for the locals, Israeli soldiers are not enemies — their arrival is no surprise.****\n\n♦️When we assert that the Syrian rebels are funded by ~~Israeli~~-backed entities, this is not a figurative claim but a literal reality. These groups are receiving financial and logistical support in various forms from the occupying forces. \n\n➡️ In essence, raising the “FSA” flag is equal to raising the ~~Israeli~~ flag, as both serve the same agenda aimed at destabilizing the region and undermining Syria’s sovereignty.\n\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

The Security Council, the international community, and Arab and Islamic countries bear responsibility for rejecting and ending it and protecting the Syrian people at a sensitive and pivotal stage in their history.\n\nWe have always warned against Israeli ambitions in the entire region and resisted them to prevent the occupation from achieving its goals. We have reiterated that the aggression on Gaza is a war of extermination and a starting point for changing the face of the region and ending the Palestinian cause.\n\nThe complete silence of Arabs, Muslims, and the international community towards the criminal aggression on Syria, with unlimited American support, and the failure to take practical measures to confront this aggression and support the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights, has led to Zionist persistence and encroachment on the countries of the region.\n\nAll steps must be taken to prevent the Israeli entity from achieving its goals, and not to remain silent or watch this brutal aggression against Syria and its people. What is happening in Syria today at the popular and political levels, and the resulting internal and external political choices, is the exclusive right of the Syrian people, independent of any external influences and pressures.\n\nWe hope that Syria will settle on the choices of its people, achieve its renaissance, and be in a position of rejecting the Israeli occupation, preventing external interference in its affairs.\n\nWe will remain a supporter of Syria and its people in their right to build their future and confront their enemy, the usurping Israeli entity.\n__\nTuesday 10-12-2024\n08 Jumada al-Akhirah 1446 AH**\n\n**🔴****@haqqintel**",

These actions further destabilize this brotherly country.\n\nThis aggressive occupation of Syrian lands coincides with the continued aggression of the Zionist army against Lebanon, its daily violations, and its attacks on Gaza. These actions place the peoples of the region in imminent danger, underscoring the unity of their struggle and the necessity of rejecting and confronting this aggression.\n\nWhile we condemn these attacks, we warn of the consequences of their continuation. We also call on the world, particularly the Arab and Islamic nations, to take firm stances against these crimes and to exert pressure in all political and legal arenas to put an end to this series of aggressions, as all the justifications presented by the enemy are baseless fabrications.\n\nThe enemy’s attempts to seize additional Syrian lands cannot establish any form of legitimate rights, as this can only be described as an ongoing occupation in the Golan Heights since 1967.\n\nWe reaffirm our solidarity with Syria and its people and stress the necessity of preserving Syria’s unity in both its land and its people.\n\nMonday, 09 December 2024\n07 Jumada al-Akhirah 1446 AH\n\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

In 1998, Hezbollah’s Shura Council expelled him, stripping him of his leadership and membership. This marked the first time someone of his rank had been removed from the organization.\n\n1️⃣ The expulsion stemmed from major disagreements over the direction of the group. Tufaili opposed Hezbollah’s decision to participate in Lebanese politics, insisting that it should focus only on fighting ~~Israel~~. His refusal to adapt to the group’s evolving strategy created growing tensions. Hezbollah’s leadership wanted to expand its role beyond military resistance, but Tufaili’s rigid views stood in the way.\n\n2️⃣ After being expelled, Tufaili returned to his home region in the Bekaa Valley, where he became a vocal critic of Hezbollah and Iran. He accused them of exploiting Lebanon for their own interests and denounced their growing influence in the region. However, his influence has faded over time, and his occasional statements are now seen as irrelevant to the group’s current activities, and to the Lebanese. \n\n3️⃣ Tufaili was expelled from Hezbollah and has since become a mouthpiece for Zionists and Wahhabis.\n\n4️⃣ Subhi al-Tufayli, has also praised Turkey’s policy in the Middle East: \n\n****Turkey is the only country that cares about Syria's security and unity, and its foreign policy is in accordance with the expectations and will of the Syrian people.****\n\nIronically, this is the same Turkey that arms and trains militants in Idlib, which al-Tufayli now commends. \n\n➡️ There is a reason he is no longer part of Hezbollah’s leadership—he was ousted and voted out.\n\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

    "text": "**📹A video is currently circulating featuring a Hamas representative in Turkey, Talal Nasser (whom we never heard of), claiming that the resistance supports Mossad agents in Syria and opposes Bashar al-Assad. \n\n🔎 Here’s why this claim should be critically evaluated:\n\n1️⃣ Historical Context: While Hamas and Syria have had conflicts in the past—most notably during the conflicts  in 2011, when Hamas supported rebel groups—Iran temporarily reduced its funding for Hamas due to this stance. However, relations between Hamas and Syria were later reconciled, with both reaffirming their shared goal of removing the ~~Israeli~~ occupation.\n\n2️⃣ Source of Authority: A representative like Talal Nasser, based in Turkey and largely unknown to many Palestinians, cannot speak authoritatively on Hamas’s stance. The official positions of Hamas come from high-ranking leaders such as Abu Obeida, Osama Hamdan, or  Shaheed Yahya Sinwar. Sinwar, in particular, supported the removal of Mossad agents in Syria and backed Bashar al-Assad. Hamdan, too, holds a similar position.\n\n3️⃣ Official Statements: To understand Hamas’s official position, one must refer to the movement’s communiqués or statements from its top leadership. The most recent public declaration on Syria came in 2024 from Osama Hamdan, a well-respected and prominent figure within Hamas, supporting Syria. \n\n4️⃣ The Political Wings: Hamas’s political and military wings have historically exhibited differing stances toward the Syrian government. The military wing has generally maintained a pro-Assad position, while the political wing’s support has varied. However, Shaheed Yahya Sinwar was in support of both. \n\n5️⃣ Disseminating videos featuring representatives like Talal Nasser, who opposes Bashar al-Assad, can create fire between Hamas and Syria. It’s important to recognize that both entities have previously experienced conflicts but have since reconciled. For instance, Ismail Haniyeh, initially critical of Syria, later retracted his statements to support Assad and opposed the “rebels.”\n\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

On the contrary, all operations are deeply interconnected, forming part of a larger, coordinated regional struggle.\n\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

    "text": "**🇱🇧 Hezbollah | Statement No. 4638 Issued by the Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance 2/2\n\n\n4️⃣  Operational Highlights and Achievements:\n\n   - Despite “israel’s” ground operations in Lebanon since October 1, 2024, the enemy has failed to occupy or establish a foothold in any first-line villages. It has also been unable to create a military or security buffer zone, disrupt rocket and drone launches, or deter attacks on its interior. Resistance fighters have continued to target the enemy from border villages until the last day of the aggression.  \n\n   - The second phase of the ground invasion was merely a political and media announcement. The enemy failed to advance into second-line villages, suffering heavy losses in locations like Khiyam, Ainatha, Talousa, Bint Jbeil, and Qouzah. Its only attempt to advance into Bayada and Shamaa ended disastrously, with elite forces retreating under heavy blows.\n\n5️⃣  Preparedness of Resistance Defenses:\n\n   - The Resistance’s defense strategy relies on a zone-based system, with over 300 defensive lines south of the Litani River, all fully equipped in terms of personnel, weaponry, and capabilities. The outcomes in Bayada and Khiyam testify to this preparedness.  \n\n6️⃣ Ongoing Vigilance:\n\n   - The Islamic Resistance Operations Room affirms that its fighters across all military specialties remain fully prepared to counter any “israeli” aggression or ambitions. They will vigilantly monitor enemy movements and withdrawals beyond the border, ready to defend Lebanon’s sovereignty and honor, and to uphold the dignity of its people.  \n\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

    "text": "**🇱🇧 Hezbollah | Statement No. 4638 Issued by the Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance 1/2\n\nبِسْمِ اللَّـهِ الرحمن الرَّحِيمِ\n ﴿أُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَاتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ظُلِمُوا وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ على نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ﴾\n صدق الله العلي العظيم\n\nIn support of the steadfast Palestinian people, in solidarity with their brave and honorable resistance, and in defense of our resilient Lebanese people, the Islamic Resistance continues its path, adhering to the command of its late Secretary General and supreme martyr, His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah (رض), and under the leadership of his successor, His Eminence Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem (ح). Over more than 13 months, the Resistance has maintained its pledge and jihad, achieving victory over the delusional enemy who failed to break its resolve or weaken its determination. The battlefield spoke loudest, with its pure and devout fighters relying on Allah to thwart the enemy's plans, defeat its forces, and write epic chapters of steadfastness and sacrifice in the battles of \"Al-Aqsa Flood” and \"Awliya' al-Ba's\".\n\nOn this auspicious occasion, the Resistance announces the following:  \n\n1️⃣  Operations Statistics:\n\n   - Since the launch of \"Al-Aqsa Flood\" operations on October 8, 2023, the Islamic Resistance has carried out more than 4,637 declared military operations over 417 days, averaging 11 operations per day.  \n\n   - Among these, 1,666 diverse military operations** have been conducted since the start of the “israeli” aggression on Lebanon and the launch of \"Awliya' al-Ba's\" on September 17, 2024, averaging 23 operations daily. These operations targeted “israeli” army sites, barracks, bases, cities, and settlements from the Lebanese-Palestinian border to beyond Tel Aviv. They also included heroic confrontations with enemy ground incursions into Lebanese territory.\n\n2️⃣  Key Operations within \"Awliya' al-Ba’s”:\n\n   - The Resistance carried out 105 specialized operations as part of the \"Khaybar Series\", targeting dozens of critical military and security bases for the first time in the Zionist entity's history. These operations used advanced ballistic missiles, precision-guided rockets, and sophisticated drones, reaching depths of up to 150 kilometers inside occupied Palestine, beyond Tel Aviv.\n\n3️⃣  Enemy Losses:\n\n   - Since the start of “israel’s” ground invasion of Lebanese territory on October 1, 2024, and up to the date of this statement:\n\n     - Over 130 “israeli” soldiers and officers killed and more than 1,250 wounded.  \n\n     - Destruction of 59 Merkava tanks, 11 military bulldozers, 2 Hummer vehicles, 2 armored personnel carriers, and 2 troop transporters.  \n\n     - Downing of 6 Hermes 450 drones, 2 Hermes 900 drones, and 1 quadcopter drone.  \n\n     - (Note: These figures exclude losses in Israeli bases, barracks, settlements, and occupied cities.)\n\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

    "text": "**🇸🇾 Role of Syria in the current war (2/2):\n\n4️⃣ Furthermore, the enemy has been carrying out intensive attacks on the southwestern countryside of Homs and the Syrian-Lebanese border near Al-Qusayr for weeks, targeting bridges, roads, the city itself, and residential neighborhoods. The most violent and extensive attack on the region was tonight.\n\n5️⃣ The enemy's goals in striking the land routes are to prevent the arrival of humanitarian aid and also to try to cut off the military supply routes for the resistance. There is an intensive Arab-Western media effort to establish the narrative that Syria can stop support and cut off supplies to the resistance.\n\n6️⃣ Today, the Russian President's special envoy to Syria, Alexander Lavrentiev, in a statement to Sputnik, gave a clear answer to \"Israel\" about its desire to obtain guarantees to prevent the supply of weapons from Syria to Lebanon, that this is outside the scope of the Russian military's mandate. The meaning of the message is that Russia is not concerned with this issue and has nothing to do with it.\n\n7️⃣ Syria informed its ally that the issue of supplying weapons to the resistance has nothing to do with Russia and that it has no mandate in this matter, and the matter is impossible to happen. The series of attacks on scientific research and defense laboratories in Damascus Masyaf, Homs, Hama, and even the last aggression on Aleppo.\n\n8️⃣ The enemy is currently intensifying its aggression on the central region, and we have seen throughout the past months an intensification of its attacks, especially on the Syrian Arab Army's ammunition depots and facilities, especially in Homs, Hama, Masyaf, and the roads in the central region, and the humanitarian and relief aid convoys in Homs and the roads near the Syrian-Lebanese border.\n\n9️⃣ The enemy continues to escalate against Syria, and we must expect a major escalation and intensification of the aggression, especially on scientific research facilities, defense laboratories, ammunition depots, air defense sites, radars, roads, and bridges near the border with Lebanon, and any sites that the enemy believes can form a base and means of support for the resistance.\n\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

    "text": "**🇸🇾 Role of Syria in the current war (1/2):\n\n♦️A few days ago, the “Israeli” enemy carried out an attack on a scientific research facility and defense laboratories of the Syrian Arab Army near Al-Safira in the Aleppo countryside, the attack targeted two points on the site. \n\n➡️ Why did the enemy carry out this attack? The answer is in the thread below. \n\n1️⃣ There is a general description today of Syria's role as a bridge for weapons, but in fact this description is not accurate. It is a bridge for weapons coming from Iran. Syria, with its scientific research centers, defense laboratories, and military manufacturing facilities, is a manufacturer of the military capabilities of the resistance. \n\n2️⃣ Syria manufactures weapons from bullets to missiles and artillery, trains and supplies the resistance with them, and is a huge strategic reservoir for all forms of military, logistical, human, and manufacturing materials support. It is a base on which the resistance in Lebanon relies and a strategic depth that embraces all resistance movements in the region. \n\n3️⃣ Syria, with Iran, in the last decade has helped the resistance in Lebanon possess the ability to manufacture part of its military capabilities, including drones and the development of some of its missiles. At the same time, the campaign of doubt and distortion of Syria's role by the Arab media. The West continues without stopping while every aggression that occurs on Syria belies everything they say. What is said and promoted in the Arab and Western media and what is written in articles is nothing more than their dreams and wishes. Whoever wants to take their word for it, that is his problem. President Assad’s speech today in Riyadh is not just words, but is based on actions in the past and will continue in the present and in the future, God willing. We see evidence of this with every “Israeli” aggression on Syria.\n\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

The US empire has two wings: racist liberalism and cosmopolitan liberalism. The latter form welcomes all races to be a part of its godless system and for a diverse group of people to oppress and subjugate the rest of the world.\n\nIn light of this peak ignorance and slave mentality, we re-share our article on the shared struggle between African Americans and Palestinians. https://basirapress.org/2024/02/21/malcolm-x-palestine/",

Colonel Jack Neriya, a former advisor to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, said Hezbollah fighters are allowing ~~Israeli~~ troops to advance before trapping them in ambushes, which has posed challenges even for “elite” units:\n\n****This ambush tactic has created extreme challenges for ~~Israeli~~ forces, including elite units such as Golani and other commandos.****\n\n2️⃣ Despite heavy support from artillery and air power, ~~Israel’s~~ genocidal campaign has made no victories. \n\n3️⃣ The ~~Israeli~~ outlet noted that this ongoing failure could lead to higher ~~Israeli~~ casualties than in any war since the late 1940s.\n\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

Your people are with you and pray for you day and night, and you will be victorious, God willing.\n\n• The enemy has not been able to establish its presence in any village on the borders until now, but was forced to retreat from some points.\n\n• The enemy does not dare to raise its head and tanks from the areas it has infiltrated because the resistance missiles are rushing it.\n\n• The enemy is fighting from a distance and the resistance fighters are thwarting its attempts to seize the geography.\n\n• Resistance missiles will continue until the occupation stops its aggression.\n\n• The response to any new ~~Israeli~~ assassination will be more adherence to our right to defend our country.\n**\n**🔴****@haqqintel**",

Only when I opened up my phone after prayer did I find out about this theatrical performance that Iran successfully thwarted. Even a supposed second wave didn't do anything, they were all shot down. \n\nIran has definitely established deterrence, the Zionists just wanted a Hollywood performance for their audience of bloodthirsty supremacists.\n\nOnly cowards commit genocide. They can't take on those who have strength. \n\nTo all those apologetic liberals who think Iran should sell out its military power so you can get Nike from the official sweatshop instead of knockoffs from the sweatshop across the street, you are safe and secure thanks to this military power and the sacrifices of the martyrs. You would be in a Gaza like situation if it weren't for this, and being a collaborator isn't a guarantee for safety, as they view collaborators like a cup of yogurt - they will eat you until you are finished and then toss you into the trash. Be a bit grateful and stop making it your life goal to sell the country.",

The enemy forces attempted to infiltrate towards the town of Taybeh from the south and east, but the Islamic Resistance fighters confronted them with machine guns and rockets, resulting in a large number of dead and wounded among the infiltrating force. When an enemy support force attempted to advance to withdraw the casualties, the fighters confronted them, inflicting more losses on them and forcing them to retreat. A Merkava tank attempted to advance towards the eastern outskirts of the town of Taybeh, but the fighters targeted it with a guided missile, destroying it and killing and wounding its crew. The fighters also monitored an enemy force's attempt to infiltrate towards the forest of the town of Adaisseh, so they confronted it with appropriate weapons and forced it to retreat. - Fifth axis: The operations area of ​​the enemy's 210th Division, extending from the village of Ghajar to the occupied Lebanese Shebaa Farms. The enemy forces are trying to advance in the outskirts of the towns of Kfar Shuba and Shebaa and control the security barriers near the border, which will protect the border from any ground advance by the resistance.

The operations on this axis were limited to attempts to infiltrate towards the southern neighborhoods of the villages of Marouhin, Al-Dhahira, Yarin, and Alma al-Shaab, with the aim of booby-trapping and blowing up houses for fear of their use by the Mujahideen. The Islamic Resistance fighters confronted these attempts and targeted the enemy's gatherings and advance paths in Ras al-Naqoura, Hanita, and the surroundings of the village of Al-Dhahira.\n\n♦️ The second axis: The operations area of ​​the enemy's 36th Division, extending from Ramya in the west to Rmeish in the east (Aita al-Shaab including), and from Rmeish to Aitaroun in the east.\n\nAfter the heroic confrontations witnessed in the Aita al-Shaab - al-Qawzah - Ramya triangle last week, during which the enemy suffered heavy losses at the hands of the resistance fighters. In the past few days, the enemy tried to advance towards the \"Abu al-Laban\" height east of the town of Aita al-Shaab with the aim of occupying it and tightening control over the town. The Islamic Resistance fighters confronted the enemy forces and targeted its gatherings and advance paths in Khallet Warda and the vicinity of the town of Aita al-Shaab. They also targeted many forces that infiltrated the vicinity of the municipality building, which resulted in the deaths and injuries of its members, while the evacuation operations continued for long hours due to the repeated targeting of the resistance. The division's formations are trying to advance towards the center of the town of Aitaroun from the eastern and western neighborhoods with the aim of occupying it and isolating it from its surroundings. In conjunction with attempts to advance towards the center of the towns of Maroun al-Ras and Yaroun from the southern neighborhoods of the two towns. The Islamic Resistance fighters are targeting the gatherings and paths of these formations with dense and repeated salvos, which inflicts heavy losses on them, hinders their movement and forces them to retreat towards uncovered areas.\n\n♦️ The third axis: The operations area of ​​the 91st Division in the enemy army, extends from Blida in the south to Houla in the north. The enemy forces advanced in this axis through invisible paths towards some of the eastern neighborhoods of the towns of Mays al-Jabal, Muhaibib and Blida, where they booby-trapped some houses and blew them up. The enemy forces are trying to advance towards the eastern neighborhoods of the town of Houla amidst violent confrontations with the Islamic Resistance fighters.\nIt is worth noting that what the enemy army has done in terms of booby-trapping and blowing up the houses of the town of Muhaibib comes after its inability to tighten its control over the town and stabilize its forces for fear of being targeted by the resistance.\n\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

Shares of McDonald’s fell more than eight percent in after-hours trading following the announcement.\n\n♦️The outbreak, which began in late September, has spread across 10 Western states, with most of the 49 cases concentrated in Colorado and Nebraska.\n\n♦️Ten people have been hospitalized, including one child suffering from hemolytic uremic syndrome, a serious condition that damages blood vessels in the kidneys.\n\n__“An older adult in Colorado has died,” according to the CDC.__\n\n➡️ We urged the public to boycott McDonald’s in protest of the ~~Israeli~~ genocide against children in occupied Palestine. Yet, despite the call for action, many selfish individuals, unable to go five minutes without their disease-burgers, are now facing the consequences. \n\nWe’ve been warning you for more than a year now.\n\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

The arrival of the US envoy does not change our belief that the US is the root of terrorism. Hezbollah has fully regained its capabilities, as even the enemy acknowledges-whether you believe it or not.\n\n4️⃣ “israel” bears full responsibility for the safety and well-being of our prisoners, and any statements or confessions extracted from them under pressure are worthless. We are people who never abandon our prisoners in jails.\n\n5️⃣ It won’t be long before we take “israeli” soldiers as hostages, and we will then negotiate over them.\n\n__6️⃣ Hezbollah's military and logistical support lines have been fully restored, and the enemy has suffered heavy losses in both personnel and tanks.__\n\n7️⃣ The Islamic Resistance claims responsibility for Caesarea operation and for the targeting of Netanyahu's residence.\n\n8️⃣ The Resistance and its command and coordination system are in excellent condition.\n\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

He was a shining image of Resistance and struggle. He stood with unwavering determination against the cruel, transgressive enemy, striking them with his acumen and courage. He struck the irreparable blow of October 7 [to the Zionist regime] that will be remembered as a part of the history of this region. And then he ascended to the realm of the martyrs with dignity and pride. For one like him who had dedicated his life to the battle against the usurping, cruel enemy, anything less than martyrdom would have been an unworthy fate.\n\nIndeed, his loss is painful for the Resistance Front. However, this front did not halt its progress in the wake of the martyrdoms of eminent figures such as Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Fathi Shaqaqi, Rantisi, and Ismail Haniyeh. Similarly, it will not falter the least with the martyrdom of Sinwar either, God willing. Hamas is alive and will stay alive.\n\nAs always, we will stand by the sincere mujahideen and fighters, with God’s help and guidance.\nI offer my condolences on the martyrdom of our brother Yahya al-Sinwar to his family, his comrades, and to all those devoted to jihad on the path of God. I congratulate them and offer my condolences for this loss.\n\nMay God’s greetings and peace be upon His righteous servants.\n\nSayyid Ali Khamenei (ح) Mehr 28, 1403 [Oct. 19, 2024]\n\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

O masses of our Arab and Islamic nation:\n  \nThe Martyr Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades march to Al-Ula, the great martyr, Yahya al-Sanwar, “Abu Ibrahim,” the leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, who rose unplanned in the most honorable of battles in defense of the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque, our people, and their legitimate rights. It is a matter of pride for our movement to present leaders. Before the soldiers, and for its leaders to advance the convoy of martyrs of our people who gave their lives and blood for the sake of God and on the path to liberating Palestine, and for its leader to be martyred among his Mujahideen brothers as a hero clashing with the invaders who thought that Gaza could be an easy prey for their cowardly army. \n\nThe path of our leader, “Abu Ibrahim,” was an honorable jihadi path, during which he was part of the founding generation of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas and its military and security services. Then he sacrificed the flower of his youth as a prisoner in the occupation prisons for more than twenty years before he emerged with his head held high in the “Loyalty to the Free” deal. When he was released from prison, he refused to continue the path of jihad and did not taste any rest. He supervised the movement’s military work in the three regions and had an important role in the process of unifying the resistance fronts on the road to Jerusalem. Then he headed the movement in Gaza, so that his leadership period constituted a qualitative shift in its advocacy, political and military path. Which culminated in the \"Al-Aqsa Flood\", and in the course of national relations and joint resistance work, before he headed the movement at home and abroad following the martyrdom of the great leader Ismail Haniyeh. \n\nWhen the resistance factions, with Hamas at their heart, decided to enter this major and decisive battle in the history of the Palestinian people’s jihad and in the path of our nation, they knew that the price of liberation was very high, paid by all peoples before they were liberated from their occupiers, and they were ready for the ranks of the sacrificed people of their people to advance. The leaders and soldiers came forward, refusing to submit to the enemy or remain silent regarding its injustice and plundering of the legitimate rights of our people. The march of our jihad will not stop until the liberation of Palestine, the expulsion of the last Zionist from it, and the restoration of all our legitimate rights. The best proof of this is that our people have not broken or surrendered a year after the battle of the “Al-Aqsa Flood,” despite The heavy prices he paid, despite the brutal Zionist genocide. \n\nThis criminal enemy is delusional if he thinks that by assassinating great resistance leaders like Sinwar, Haniyeh, Nasrallah, Al-Arouri and others, he can extinguish the flame of resistance or push it to retreat. Rather, it will continue and escalate until the legitimate goals of our people are achieved. Martyrdom is the highest aspiration of our leaders, and their blood will be a beacon that illuminates the path to liberation and a fire. It burns the aggressors, and our leaders have left behind hundreds of thousands of mujahideen from our people and nation who are determined to fight the Zionist occupation until Palestine and the Al-Aqsa Mosque are cleansed of its defilement and swept away from our land, God willing.\n\nIt is a jihad of victory or martyrdom.\nMartyr Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades - Palestine\nFriday 15 Rabi’ al-Thani 1446 AH\nCorresponding to 10/18/2024 AD\n\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

Since the beginning of ground operations near the Lebanese-Palestinian border, the \"israeli\" enemy has deployed five military divisions comprising over 70,000 officers and soldiers, along with hundreds of tanks and military vehicles. In contrast, hundreds of fighters from the Islamic Resistance are fully prepared to counter any \"Israeli\" ground incursion into southern Lebanese villages.\n\n1. Ground Engagements:\n\nThe beginning of this week witnessed an escalation in the heroic confrontations between the fighters of the Islamic Resistance and the \"israeli\" enemy's officers and soldiers advancing through several routes in the eastern and western sectors towards the villages of Al-Odaisseh, Rab El  Thalathin, Blida, Markaba, Al-Qawzah, Aita al-Shaab, and Ramya, under heavy artillery and air cover targeting the mentioned villages and their surroundings. According to pre-prepared field plans, the fighters of the Islamic Resistance engaged the enemy forces in and around some villages by targeting their advance routes and luring them into ambushes within some border villages. Violent clashes took place with the enemy at close range, especially in the towns of Al-Qawzah and Rab El Thalathin, resulting in 10 enemy fatalities and over 150 injuries, as well as the destruction of 9 \"Merkava\" tanks and 4 military bulldozers.\n\n2. Rocket Force:\n\nThe rocket force of the Islamic Resistance continues to escalate day by day, targeting \"israeli\" enemy concentrations in military sites and barracks along the Lebanese-Palestinian border, as well as settlements and cities in the north, reaching their military bases deep within occupied Palestine, using various types of missiles, including precision-guided ones that are being deployed for the first time.\n\n3. Air Force:\n\nThe air force of the Islamic Resistance continues to escalate day by day, targeting enemy military bases from the Lebanese-Palestinian border to deep within occupied Palestine, utilizing various types of attack drones, including advanced ones being used for the first time, in addition to reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering missions.\n\n4. Air Defense Unit:\n\nFighters of the Islamic Resistance in the air defense unit have successfully engaged \"israeli\" military aircraft that violate Lebanese airspace, both reconnaissance and combat. They managed to shoot down two reconnaissance aircraft of the type \"Hermes 450.\"\n\nAccording to observations from the fighters of the Islamic Resistance, the enemy's losses have reached approximately 55 killed and over 500 injured among \"israeli\" officers and soldiers, in addition to the destruction of 20 \"Merkava\" tanks, 4 military bulldozers, an armored vehicle, and a troop carrier, along with the downing of two \"Hermes 450\" drones.\n\n⭕ This tally does not include the losses of the \"Israeli\" enemy in military bases and barracks along the Lebanese-Palestinian border extending into occupied Palestine.\n\n__Based on the directives of the Resistance leadership, the Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance announces a transition to a new and escalatory phase in the confrontation with the \"israeli\" enemy, which will be reflected in the developments and events of the coming days.\n__\n“And victory is only from Allah; indeed, Allah is Exalted and Wise.”\n\nFriday, October 18, 2024  \n14 Rabi' al-Thani 1446 AH\n\n🔴****@haqqintel**",

Luka Anda adalah luka kami, rasa sakit Anda adalah rasa sakit kami, dan harapan Anda adalah harapan kami dihancurkan dengan pertolongan Tuhan Yang Maha Kuasa, dan kita akan bersama-sama menghadapi dampak agresi, sama seperti kita bersama-sama menghadapi genosida.\n\n⭕ Abu Ubaida: Ketidakadilan dan genosida yang dilakukan para penjahat akan membuka pintu neraka bagi mereka dari Tuhan Yang Maha Esa dan dari hamba-hamba-Nya, dan konsekuensinya tentu akan sangat mengerikan bagi mereka yang menimpa kita dan yang kita rasakan serta derita bersama rakyat kita adalah harga dari sebuah kemenangan besar. Penaklukan Mubarak adalah sebuah kenyataan yang tak terelakkan.\n\n⭕ Abu Ubaida : Kami akan mengetahui dan kalian akan mengetahui bahwa setiap tetes darah yang tertumpah di bumi ini lebih berharga daripada memenuhi bumi dengan emas, karena itu adalah harga untuk membebaskan bumi, umat manusia, dan tempat-tempat suci.\n\n⭕ Abu Ubaida: Wahai masyarakat kami di Gaza, inilah saatnya solidaritas, saling ketergantungan, dan kasih sayang. Sama seperti kami menghadirkan model kepahlawanan dan kehebatan di lapangan, kami juga akan menghadirkan model ketabahan, konstruksi, dan meraih kebenaran. , menggagalkan semua rencana dan ambisi pendudukan, dan mengalahkannya dengan kemauan dan persatuan kita, Insya Allah Yang Maha Kuasa.\n\nMinggu : 19 Rajab 1446 H\nSesuai dengan: 19 Januari 2025",

    "text": "⭕️ Pernyataan Pers\n\nSelama tujuh puluh tiga hari, pendudukan fasis Israel telah melakukan perang genosida terhadap rakyat Palestina di Jalur Gaza, menggunakan segala jenis senjata, amunisi, dan bom yang dilarang secara internasional dan tanpa pandang bulu membom sekolah-sekolah dan tenda-tenda yang menampung ratusan ribu pengungsi. masyarakat dan rumah sakit yang dilindungi oleh hukum humaniter internasional.\n\nSemua ini dan lebih banyak lagi yang terjadi di depan mata seluruh dunia, dengan dukungan terang-terangan dari AS, Inggris, dan beberapa negara Eropa, mengingat ketidakmampuan komunitas internasional dan semua lembaga PBB yang tidak berfungsi untuk menghentikan agresi ini karena sikap keras kepala dan arogansi pemerintah Amerika dalam penggunaan hak vetonya secara kurang ajar.\n\nAgresi genosida ini telah mengakibatkan pembunuhan massal terhadap lebih dari 19.000 martir, sekitar 52.000 orang terluka, dan hampir 8.000 orang hilang, 70% di antaranya adalah anak-anak dan perempuan. Pendudukan Israel sejauh ini telah melakukan 1.700 pembantaian terhadap warga sipil dan orang-orang tidak bersenjata yang tidak bersalah. Di Tepi Barat yang diduduki, lebih dari 290 martir Palestina telah dibunuh oleh pasukan pendudukan Israel sejak peluncuran agresi di Gaza pada 7 Oktober, ditambah dengan pembatasan ketat yang diberlakukan terhadap warga Palestina di Yerusalem yang diduduki dan di Al-Aqsa. Masjid.\n\nDalam konteks ini, kami menegaskan hal-hal berikut:\n\nTrio perang yang kalah (Netanyahu-Gantz-Gallant) belum dan tidak akan mampu mencapai tujuan agresif mereka.\n\nPemerintah fasis Israel, yang dipimpin oleh penjahat perang Netanyahu, tidak peduli dengan kehidupan warga sipil Palestina, tentara, dan tahanannya. Tidak ada bukti yang lebih jelas mengenai hal ini selain berlanjutnya pembunuhan terhadap tahanan oleh pasukan pendudukan Israel. Mereka secara keliru mengklaim bahwa mereka memulai agresi ini untuk membebaskan tahanan mereka, namun sebenarnya, mereka membunuh mereka agar tidak membayar harga yang pantas, yaitu kesepakatan pertukaran tahanan dengan perlawanan Palestina, yang mana tahanan Palestina di penjara-penjara Israel akan dibebaskan.\n\nAdapun perlawanan Palestina, mereka masih bertahan, memberikan pukulan keras dan menimbulkan kerugian besar baik melalui kendaraan atau pasukan Israel yang menyerang. Pada saat yang sama, kami sedih dengan apa yang kami saksikan mengenai penderitaan rakyat kami akibat perang genosida Israel yang menargetkan tanpa pandang bulu di seluruh wilayah Gaza. Kami di sini menyebutkan bahwa 92 jurnalis Palestina sejauh ini telah dibunuh oleh kebrutalan tersebut, yang bertujuan untuk membungkam dan menakuti mereka dalam menyampaikan apa yang terjadi di Gaza.\n\nSatu-satunya pencapaian pendudukan Israel adalah kejahatan perang, genosida, pembunuhan besar-besaran terhadap anak-anak dan perempuan, penghancuran infrastruktur, dan penghapusan seluruh aspek kehidupan. Namun, rakyat Palestina kami yang teguh menunjukkan gambaran paling indah tentang kesabaran, ketangguhan, patriotisme, keterikatan pada tanah air, dan dukungan tanpa syarat terhadap perlawanan mereka.\n\nKami terus mengatakan bahwa pemerintah AS sepenuhnya bertanggung jawab atas pembantaian dan pelanggaran yang terjadi di tangan tentara pendudukan Israel di Gaza melalui pengiriman senjata tanpa syarat AS untuk membunuh warga Palestina tanpa pertanggungjawaban apa pun.\n\nTerlepas dari posisi Amerika Serikat, Gerakan Hamas memperhatikan seruan yang semakin meningkat dari beberapa pemerintah negara-negara barat untuk mengakhiri agresi terhadap Gaza, selain seruan lain di seluruh dunia yang menuntut gencatan senjata segera di Gaza; yang terakhir adalah pernyataan Kanada, Australia dan Selandia Baru yang mendukung gencatan senjata berkelanjutan di Gaza. Kami menyambut baik perkembangan ini dan menganggapnya sebagai arah yang tepat untuk mengisolasi pemerintah fasis Israel secara global dan mengakhiri pendudukan terlama di zaman modern ini.",

Ini adalah sesuatu yang menurut saya mustahil...karena Amerika menghubungkan keberadaannya dengan keberadaan Negara Israel.\n  \n  Amerika tidak akan menyerah mendukung Israel dengan senjata, dan pidato Biden hari ini seperti ancaman bagi Netanyahu: Anda akan mengubah pemerintahan Anda, atau Anda akan diubah.",

Para pahlawan Qassam dan orang-orang perlawanan tidak tahu bagaimana harus menyerah atau dikalahkan, dan kata (menyerah) tidak tahu. bahkan muncul di kamus mereka.  Slogan mereka yang terus-menerus adalah: Jihad, kemenangan, atau syahid.\n\n Kami akan menggagalkan semua rencana musuh Nazi ini untuk menggusur rakyat kami, kami akan mengubur impian dan ilusi mereka, dan kami akan mengusir mereka yang kalah, mengikuti jejak kekecewaan dan kehilangan.  Para prajurit dan perwiranya memasuki Gaza hidup-hidup dan tidak akan pergi kecuali dalam keadaan berkeping-keping.\n\n Penggunaan hak veto Amerika terhadap resolusi Dewan Keamanan PBB mengenai gencatan senjata kemanusiaan di Gaza merupakan eskalasi yang dilakukan Presiden AS Biden dan pemerintahannya atas kejahatan pembersihan etnis dan pembantaian yang dilakukan terhadap rakyat Palestina di Jalur Gaza.\n\n “Kami menghargai upaya Kelompok Arab dan Islam yang mengadakan pertemuan Majelis Umum PBB hari ini yang menuntut gencatan senjata segera karena alasan kemanusiaan.”  Pernyataan ini juga menyerukan perlindungan warga sipil dan pengiriman bantuan kemanusiaan.\n\n Kami mengutuk keras dan mengecam niat pemerintah Perancis untuk menjadi tuan rumah konferensi internasional dengan partisipasi entitas Nazi-Zionis untuk membahas apa yang mereka sebut “membatasi pendanaan gerakan Hamas dan aktivitasnya di Internet.” Kami menganggapnya sebagai bias yang mencolok. mendukung pendudukan, mengidentifikasi diri dengan mereka dalam memerangi rakyat Palestina dan narasi mereka di dunia maya, dan penolakan terhadap hak kebebasan rakyat kami.Untuk menentukan nasib sendiri, Perancis dan negara-negara Eropa harus mempertimbangkan kembali bias terang-terangan mereka terhadap pendudukan dan pendudukan. kebijakan yang rasis, dan mematuhi hukum internasional dan kemanusiaan jika mereka masih memiliki hati nurani atau penghormatan terhadap hak asasi manusia.\n\n Kami menyambut baik sikap Perdana Menteri Spanyol, Irlandia, Belgia dan Malta yang menyerukan penghentian perang Zionis di Jalur Gaza, dan kami menyerukan tekanan lebih besar bagi Uni Eropa untuk mengambil keputusan untuk segera menghentikan perang genosida terhadap rakyat kami. .\n\n Kami berterima kasih kepada semua masyarakat bebas yang menanggapi seruan untuk melakukan serangan menyeluruh kemarin, Senin, sebagai bentuk solidaritas terhadap Gaza, dan kami salut pada semua inisiatif dan aktivitas untuk melanjutkan gerakan global menghentikan agresi.\n Kami menyambut baik semua posisi persaudaraan masyarakat Arab dan Islam, di Kuwait, Yordania, Yaman, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, dan masyarakat Arab dan Islam lainnya serta masyarakat bebas di dunia, yang menyatakan solidaritas mereka terhadap Gaza dan ketabahannya. orang dalam menghadapi agresi.\n Kami memperbarui seruan kami untuk melanjutkan dan meningkatkan segala bentuk gerakan dan aktivitas massa di seluruh kota di dunia, hingga agresi berhenti.\n Sebagai kesimpulan, kami menegaskan kepada dunia bahwa rakyat kami dan rakyat kami di Gaza mempunyai hak untuk menjalani kehidupan yang bebas dan bermartabat di tanah mereka, tanpa pengepungan, kelaparan, pemboman, ancaman, atau pengungsian, seperti masyarakat lainnya di Gaza. Kami mengatakan dan menegaskan bahwa pendudukan dan pemukimnya tidak akan menikmati keamanan, ketenangan, dan stabilitas sampai mereka menikmatinya. Rakyat kami, rakyat kami di Gaza yang bangga.\n\n Ini adalah jihad kemenangan atau kesyahidan",

Children of Heaven berkisah tentang kakak-beradik bernama Ali dan Zahra yang terlahir dari keluarga miskin.\n\nMereka harus saling bergantian memakai sepatu tiap ke sekolah dikarenakan sepatu Zahra hilang oleh Ali ketika ia sedang menghutang sayuran di pasar.\n\nSepatu Zahra sebenarnya sudah sangat butut dan jebol. Tapi karena orangtua mereka belum punya uang, akhirnya mereka memutuskan untuk mensol sepatu Zahra agar dapat digunakan lagi.\n\nSaat itu Ali disuruh mengambil sepatu tersebut di tukang sol. Tapi Ali malah kehilangan sepatu Zahra yang ia letakkan di luar, tepatnya di dekat ranjang sayuran. Padahal seorang pemulung telah mengambilnya karena berpikir sepatu itu sudah tidak dipakai (mungkin saking bututnya).\n\nAli pun mencarinya kemana-mana tapi tidak ketemu jua. Sampai akhirnya dia terpaksa bilang pada Zahra bahwa sepatunya hilang. Zahra pun sedih karena itu adalah sepatu dia satu-satunya untuk ke sekolah besok.\n\nAli tak tega melihat adiknya menangis dan ia merasa bersalah sekali. Akhirnya ia pun memutuskan untuk meminjamkan sepatunya untuk dipakai Zahra ke sekolah. Padahal Ali juga hanya punya satu sepasang sepatu, itupun sudah agak butut.\n\nMereka pun akhirnya harus saling bergantian memakai sepatu tersebut. Zahra yang masuk sekolah di pagi hari harus berlari cepat saat pulang sekolah agar Ali dapat segera memakai sepatu saat Ali hendak berangkat sekolah di siang harinya, selisih waktu sekolah antara mereka tidak terlalu banyak sehingga mereka harus saling berlari agar tepat waktu.\n\nKarena hal itu, Ali jadi sering terlambat datang ke sekolah sehingga ia kerap dimarahi oleh salah satu gurunya. Padahal segitu ia sudah berlari sangat cepat.\n\nSampai akhirnya Ali mengikuti perlombaan lari jarak jauh di sekolahnya dan berharap mendapat juara ketiga. Kenapa ketiga?\n\nKarena hadiah juara ketiga itu adalah sepasang sepatu olahraga. Tapi sayang, Ali malah jadi juara pertama pada perlombaan itu. Bukannya senang, tapi Ali justru sedih karena tidak mampu menepati janjinya kepada Zahra untuk jadi juara ketiga.\n\nWalau ceritanya sangat sederhana, namun film ini sangat sarat akan pesan moralnya. Kehidupan anak- anak miskin di Iran begitu tergambar jelas dalam film karya Majid Majidi ini.\n\nSelain itu, film yang juga tayang di AS dan beberapa negara Asia Timur lainnya ini juga selalu berhasil membuat siapapun yang menontonnya menitikkan air mata.\n\n\nsegera memakai sepatu saat Ali hendak berangkat sekolah di siang harinya, selisih waktu sekolah antara mereka tidak terlalu banyak sehingga mereka harus saling berlari agar tepat waktu.\n\nKarena hal itu, Ali jadi sering terlambat datang ke sekolah sehingga ia kerap dimarahi oleh salah satu gurunya.

You were like parents to her, letting her go into your rooms whenever she wanted. She’s admitted that she feels like all of you are her friends, and not just friends, but truly beloved and good people. \n\nThank you, thank you, thank you for the many hours you spent as caregivers. Thank you for being patient with her and showering her with sweets, fruits, and everything available even when you didn’t have it. \n\nChildren should not be held in captivity, but thanks to you and other kind people we met along the way, my daughter felt like a queen in Gaza... In general, she says she felt as though she was the center of the world. She hasn't met anyone on our long journey, from the rank and file to the leadership, who didn't treat her with gentleness, affection, and love. \n\nI will forever be a prisoner of gratitude because she did not leave here with a lifelong psychological trauma. I will remember your kind behavior, granted here despite the difficult situation you were dealing with yourselves and the severe losses you suffered here in Gaza. I wish in this world we could truly be good friends. \n\nI wish you all health and well-being... Health and love to you and your families' children. Many thanks. \n\nDanyal and Emilia\nNov 27, 2023",

Anda seperti orang tua baginya, membiarkan dia masuk ke kamar Anda kapan pun dia mau.  Dia mengakui bahwa dia merasa kalian semua adalah temannya, dan bukan hanya temannya, tapi orang yang benar-benar dicintai dan baik.\n\n Terima kasih, terima kasih, terima kasih atas banyak waktu yang Anda habiskan sebagai pengasuh.  Terima kasih telah bersabar padanya dan menghujaninya dengan permen, buah-buahan, dan segala sesuatu yang tersedia bahkan saat Anda tidak memilikinya.\n\n Anak-anak tidak boleh ditahan, namun terima kasih kepada Anda dan orang-orang baik lainnya yang kami temui selama ini, putri saya merasa seperti seorang ratu di Gaza... Secara umum, dia mengatakan dia merasa seolah-olah dia adalah pusat dunia.  Dia belum pernah bertemu siapa pun dalam perjalanan panjang kami, mulai dari pangkat hingga pimpinan, yang tidak memperlakukannya dengan kelembutan, kasih sayang, dan cinta.\n\n Saya akan selamanya menjadi tawanan rasa syukur karena dia tidak meninggalkan sini dengan trauma psikologis seumur hidup.  Saya akan mengingat perilaku baik Anda, yang diberikan di sini meskipun Anda menghadapi situasi sulit dan kerugian besar yang Anda derita di sini di Gaza.  Saya berharap di dunia ini kita benar-benar bisa menjadi teman baik.\n\n Saya berharap Anda semua sehat dan sejahtera... Kesehatan dan cinta untuk Anda dan anak-anak keluarga Anda.

Suatu \"gangguan psikologis\", di mana korban penculikan justru memiliki rasa kasih sayang dan empati terhadap pelaku penculikan. Benarkah begitu? \n\nTentu saya kurang tahu. Yang jelas, hal ini menguatkan bukti-bukti bahwa Pejuang Hamas memperlakukan tawanan dengan baik, karena bukan hanya peristiwa Maya Regev ini saja. Banyak kesaksian para sandera yang positif tentang Hamas. Bahkan, infonya Zionis melarang para sandera yang dibebaskan ini untuk speak up di media.\n\nDi satu sisi, kita bisa melihat bagaimana para tentara Israel memperlakukan tawanan Palestina dengan begitu keji dan kejam. Termasuk kepada anak-anak. \n\nDalam perang, tawan-menawan itu suatu hal yang biasa. Yang tak biasa adalah bagaimana para tawanan diperlakukan dengan baik, bahkan diberikan makanan yang sama dengan yang dimakan para penawan. Yang tak biasa adalah bagaimana seorang penawan menggendong anak yang ditawan, membimbing masuk ke mobil, dan bersikap ramah. Yang tak biasa adalah seorang anak dengan spontan tersenyum dan melambaikan tangan saat hendak berpisah dengan penawannya.\n\nYa, ini bukan perang biasa. Ini perang yang penuh dengan kemuliaan akhlak dan tata krama.",

    "text": "Following the initially peaceful protest that tragically escalated, Muslims responded by assembling a group, brandishing sharp weapons, possibly in an attempt to identify those responsible for the earlier violent attack by pro-Israelis.\n\nThe perplexing question arises: why would pro-Israeli supporters while waving 🇮🇱 Flags target and harm individuals engaged in peaceful protests? This incident underscores concerning parallels in the treatment of Palestinians by the Israelis.\n\nIt's imperative to halt this cycle of violence and extinguish the seeds of hatred sown by Israelis and their global supporters.\n\nAllow me to make it clear to those supporting Israel or the pro-Israeli stance: We, in Indonesia, will steadfastly continue our support for the Palestinians in every possible way. We will not yield to the notion of violence imposed by your ideology, particularly not within Indonesia.",

    "text": "A initially peaceful protest organized by the Indonesian Islamic community took a tragic turn.\n\nIn Bitung, North Sulawesi, a group of Islamic demonstrators initially gathered peacefully to show solidarity with the Palestinian cause. Unfortunately, their peaceful demonstration took a violent turn when it was met with aggression from a group of Israeli supporters wielding sharp weapons. Reports suggest that the pro-Israelis attacked, injured, and, according to the video, even used knives, leaving the status of the victims uncertain—whether they were alive or deceased.\n\nSwift police intervention was crucial to prevent the situation from escalating further, and tear gas was deployed to disperse the violent group.",

Di saat Mereka sedang mengadakan pawai bendera atau semacamnya tepatnya saya sedikit lupa, yang memasuki tempat suci ummat Islam Yaitu Masjid Al Aqsh, Baitul maqdis.\n\nKetika Ribuan pemukim Israel terlihat meneriakkan hinaan dan hasutan untuk melakukan kekerasan terhadap warga Palestina di Gerbang Damaskus di pintu masuk Kawasan Muslim Kota Tua, Yerusalem.  Sekitar 25.000 pemukim Israel turun ke wilayah Palestina di Kota Tua dan Yerusalem sebagai upaya untuk menegakkan kedaulatan Yahudi, memprovokasi warga Palestina dan menyerang penduduk dan properti.  Kekerasan dan provokasi terus berlanjut sepanjang malam, mengakibatkan banyak orang terluka dan ditangkap.\n\n@raka_against \n\n🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸\n\nThe 2022 video, to be precise on May 29 2022, this video contains insults and incitement that hurt the feelings of the world's Muslim community and the Arab nation, by Israelis.  When they were holding a flag parade or something like that, to be precise, I forgot a little, they were entering the holy place of the Islamic community, namely the Al Aqsh Mosque, Baitul Maqdis.\n\n When thousands of Israeli settlers were seen shouting insults and inciting violence against Palestinians at the Damascus Gate at the entrance to the Muslim Quarter of the Old City, Jerusalem.  Some 25,000 Israeli settlers descended on Palestinian areas of the Old City and Jerusalem in an effort to enforce Jewish sovereignty, provoking Palestinians and attacking residents and property.  Violence and provocations continued throughout the night, resulting in many people being injured and arrested.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tv/CzajPnqJqUh/?igshid=NjZiM2M3MzIxNA==",

    "text": "Anak Gaza yang terkasih\n\n Dalam Islam diyakini bahwa nasib Anda telah dituliskan untuk Anda sebelum dunia ada.  Kapan, di mana, dan bagaimana Anda akan dilahirkan, Anda akan menjadi anak siapa, dan jalan hidup Anda di dunia ini mulai dari dalam kandungan hingga hembusan napas terakhir.\n\n Kata rahim dalam bahasa arab adalah رحم (𝐫𝐚𝐡𝐦), yang disebutkan dalam Al-Qur'an.  Kata khusus ini begitu indah karena akar kata berasal dari kata رحمه (𝐫𝐚𝐡𝐦𝐚) yang artinya rahmat.\n\n Sebelum kamu lahir, kamu tumbuh dalam kehangatan, pelukan dan belas kasihan ibumu.  Rasa sakit dan kesabaran yang ibumu lalui untuk mengandung dan membesarkanmu, memberinya imbalan berupa Jannah di bawah kakinya.  Itulah sebabnya, dalam Islam, jika ada orang di dunia ini yang paling layak menerima kebaikanmu, maka orang itu adalah ibumu.\n\n Allah (swt) mempunyai banyak sifat, dua di antaranya adalah\n\n الرحمن- 𝐀𝐫 𝐑𝐚𝐡𝐦𝐚𝐧 (𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐌𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐌𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐢𝐟𝐮𝐥)\n\n الرحيم 𝐀𝐫 𝐑𝐚𝐡𝐞𝐞𝐦 (𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐛𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐌𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐲, ()\n\n Allah SWT telah memuliakan dan menganugerahkan derajat ini kepada para ibu.  Dia bahkan memilih untuk berbagi dua atributnya dengan kata rahim.  Mengetahui sepenuhnya bahwa hal terdekat yang akan Anda alami untuk merasakan belas kasihan, dalam bentuknya yang paling murni, di dunia ini, adalah melalui ibu Anda.\n\n Maka anak Gaza tersayang, meski kehangatan tubuhmu telah lepas dari pelukan ibumu, dan kami masih berduka atasmu, kami tahu bahwa kamu telah diambil dari rahmat dunia ini, namun temukanlah kenyamanan mengetahui bahwa kamu telah dipertemukan kembali.  dengan Yang Maha Penyayang.\n\nDan atas kesabaran ibumu, kami berdoa agar surga di bawah kaki mereka untuk selamanya.\n\n@raka_against\n@raka_almaqdisi\n\n🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸",

Pada saat yang sama, pengeboman yang disengaja dilakukan di dekat #Rumah Sakit AlQuds dan #Rumah SakitIndonesia, mengungkapkan niat yang telah diperhitungkan untuk menyerang infrastruktur layanan kesehatan tanpa mempertimbangkan dampaknya.\n\n Kami menganggap #Amerika Serikat dan komunitas internasional bertanggung jawab atas pembantaian ini, yang merupakan penghinaan terhadap kemanusiaan, karena sikap diam mereka yang menyedihkan dan dukungan #Amerika yang memalukan terhadap #terorisme pendudukan N*zi-zionis.  Kami memperingatkan terhadap kelanjutan kekejaman yang dilakukan oleh penjajah kriminal ini, terutama yang menargetkan warga sipil dan fasilitas medis.”\n\n Jumat 3 November 2023",

    "text": "Sebuah laporan intelijen yang dibagikan Amerika Serikat (AS) mengungkapkan kelompok perlawanan Palestina Hamas telah merencanakan serangan ke Israel sejak lama. Laporan itu menjelaskan bagaimana cara kelompok tersebut bisa melakukan rencananya dan tidak terdeteksi pihak AS maupun Israel.\n\nPara anggota Hamas disebutkan berkomunikasi dengan cara yang sama sekali kuno dan menghindari teknologi modern saat ini. Yakni melalui jaringan telepon kabel dibangun dalam sebuah terowongan di bawah Gaza.\n\n\nKomunikasi dilakukan selama dua tahun itu. Selama waktu tersebut, mereka melakukan komunikasi dan merencanakan operasi serta memanggil ratusan anggotanya. Namun tak ada sama sekali pergerakan selama periode tersebut hingga serangan dilancarkan pada 7 Oktober 2023 lalu.\n\n\nDalam laporan tersebut disebutkan pula Hamas juga berhasil lolos dari deteksi AS dan Israel dengan menghindari penggunaan komputer maupun ponsel. Para anggota hanya melakukan komunikasi pada area yang sudah ditentukan saja.\n\n“Tidak banyak diskusi dan bolak-balik serta koordinasi di luar area terdekat,” kata salah satu sumber, dikutip dari CNN (30/10/2023).\n\nKantor Direktur Intelijen Nasional AS menolak berkomentar dan kedutaan Israel di Washington tidak menanggapi permintaan komentar.\n\nPihak intelijen AS dan Israel sebenarnya telah mendapatkan peringatan strategis. Namun kedua pihak tidak bisa mengantisipasi serangan 7 Oktober tersebut.\n\n\nSebagai informasi, terowongan tersebut dibangun Gaza selama lima belas tahun terakhir. Pihak pasukan pertahanan Israel menyebutnya sebagai ‘metro Gaza’.\n\nJaringan terowongan membentuk sebuah labirin luas. Di dalamnya menjadi tempat menyimpan seperti roket dan amunisi serta cara para militan untuk bergerak tanpa diketahui lawan.\n\nMenurut pasukan Israel, metro Gaza juga menjadi tempat pusat komando dan juga kendali penting yang dilakukan oleh Hamas. \n\n \n\n ",

    "text": "Sudah diperingatkan dalam QS al-Mā’idah/5:21, agar mereka tidak takut terhadap musuh yang akan dihadapi oleh kaum Israil dalam perjuangan merebut tanah yang dijanjikan. Bani Israil pada kenyataannya menolak perintah Tuhan untuk memasuki tanah suci yang dijanjikan, lantaran ketakutan mereka terhadap penguasa kejam yang menguasai tanah itu. Dalam QS al-Mā’idah/5:22-24, disebutkan,\n\n  Mereka berkata: “Hai Musa, Sesungguhnya di dalam negeri itu ada orang-orang yang gagah perkasa;sesungguhnya kami sekali-kali tidak akan memasukinya sebelum mereka ke luar. Jika mereka ke luar, kami pasti akan memasukinya.”\n\n  Berkatalah dua orang di antara orang-orang yang takut (kepada Allah) yang Allah telah memberi nikmat atas keduanya: \"Serbulah mereka dengan melalui pintu gerbang (kota) itu, maka bila kalian memasukinya niscaya kamu akan menang, dan hanya kepada Allah hendaknya kalian bertawakkal, jika kalian benar-benar orang yang beriman\".\n  \nMereka berkata: \"Hai Musa, kami sekali sekali tidak akan memasukinya selama-lamanya, selagi mereka ada di dalamnya, karena itu pergilah kamu bersama Tuhanmu, dan berperanglah kamu berdua. Sesungguhnya kami hanya duduk menanti di sini saja.”",

Rumah saya dibom. Ke mana saya harus pergi sekarang?\"\n\n Korban selamat lainnya mengatakan, \"Seluruh bangunan runtuh ke dalam tanah. Tidak ada yang bisa keluar, dan kami tidak dapat memindahkan siapa pun. Tidak mungkin ada orang yang masih hidup. Ini adalah tujuan pendudukan.\"\n\n Dia disela, \"Gereja Santo Porphyrius dibom! Tempat berkumpulnya umat Kristiani! Gereja ini telah berdiri selama 2.000 tahun, dan hari ini, orang-orang Yahudi menghancurkannya! Gereja tersebut tidak mempunyai senjata atau apa pun, hanya anak-anak! Lebih dari 500 orang dibom!  hilang! Semua orang Kristen di Gaza hilang.\"\n\n IOF terus menargetkan warga Gaza—yang tinggal di rumah mereka atau pengungsi yang mencari perlindungan di rumah sakit, masjid, atau gereja—tanpa pandang bulu dan tanpa peringatan.\n\n Melalui Jaringan Berita Perlawanan [Telegram]",

Menteri Luar Negeri AS Antony Blinken mengakhiri pembicaraan berjam-jam dengan Perdana Menteri Israel Benjamin Netanyahu di Tel Aviv pada Selasa pagi, mengatakan Biden akan mengunjungi Israel.\n\n Setelah mengunjungi Israel, Biden akan melakukan perjalanan ke Yordania untuk bertemu Raja Abdullah, Presiden Mesir Abdel Fattah el-Sisi dan Presiden Otoritas Palestina Mahmoud Abbas, kata juru bicara keamanan nasional AS John Kirby.\n\n (SUMBER - AL JAZEERA)",

Ini diikuti dengan kesedihan dan duka atas nyawa yang hilang.\n\n Melihat warga Palestina hidup dalam kondisi yang sangat memprihatinkan, dan melihat rumah kami hancur menjadi puing-puing, telah meninggalkan kesan permanen dalam jiwa saya.\n\n Yang tidak akan pernah terhapus dari ingatan saya adalah perasaan tidak aman dan tidak berdaya karena tidak mampu membantu mereka yang menderita.\n\n Namun, bahkan pada saat yang suram ini, ketika Israel mengerahkan kekuatan apartheidnya untuk melawan kita dengan bantuan Amerika Serikat, kita masih berkewajiban untuk mengupayakan perdamaian, keadilan, dan kebebasan.\n\n Selama lebih dari 16 tahun, Israel telah memblokade Jalur Gaza, yang mengakibatkan kekurangan makanan, obat-obatan, dan air bersih.  Meskipun hukuman kolektif terhadap warga Palestina di Gaza terus berlangsung, Yoav Gallant, menteri pertahanan Israel, menyatakan di tengah serangan Israel terbaru bahwa “kami memberlakukan pengepungan total terhadap [Gaza]. Tidak ada listrik, tidak ada makanan, tidak ada air, tidak ada bahan bakar – semuanya ditutup.”\n\n “Kami memerangi manusia dan hewan, dan kami bertindak sesuai dengan hal tersebut,” katanya.\n\n Bahasa ini menyedihkan, menjijikkan, dan melambangkan rasisme pendudukan Israel.\n \nHal ini juga memberikan kenyataan pahit kepada kita: Semua keluarga menderita, dan akan terus menderita, di bawah pengepungan ini.\n\n Kami melihatnya dengan jelas dalam serangan Israel terhadap sistem layanan kesehatan Gaza. \n\n Israel telah menargetkan ambulans dan fasilitas medis, sehingga membahayakan perawatan orang yang sakit dan terluka.\n\n Hak dasar atas layanan kesehatan telah dilanggar oleh Israel tanpa mendapat hukuman.\n\n Siapa yang akan melaporkan hal ini?\n\n Israel tidak mengizinkan jurnalis asing masuk ke Gaza untuk meliput perang tersebut, karena mereka tahu bahwa mereka melakukan hal yang mengerikan di sini.\n\n@raka_against\n@raka_almaqdisi",

Jumlah korban tewas terus meningkat, dengan perkiraan jumlah korban tewas mencapai 2.500 orang dan lebih dari 10.000 orang terluka.  Statistik yang tepat tidak tersedia.\n\n 5. Seluruh lingkungan telah hancur.\n\n 6. Bencana lingkungan mencapai puncaknya di Jalur Gaza.\n\n 7. Warga sipil Gaza tidak mempunyai perlindungan dari serangan apa pun, karena tidak ada seorang pun yang mengambil tanggung jawab terhadap serangan tersebut.\n 8. Gaza berada di ambang kehancuran\n\n kelaparan karena barang-barang di toko-toko hampir habis, dan tidak ada bantuan yang datang kepada para pengungsi.\n\n 9. Tidak ada satu pun zona aman bagi warga sipil di Gaza, yang membuat jumlah korban meningkat dua kali lipat setiap harinya.\n\n 10. Rumah sakit terancam oleh pemboman udara setelah adanya peringatan evakuasi, kurangnya kapasitas untuk menampung jumlah korban (mayat dan luka kritis), serta kekurangan bahan bakar yang mempengaruhi operasional rumah sakit.\n\n Gaza sangat membutuhkan komite gabungan internasional yang dipimpin oleh PBB dan terdiri dari negara-negara tetangga serta organisasi internasional lainnya, untuk memenuhi kebutuhan masyarakat Gaza.",

With 3,000 Hamas fighters, managed to plunge Israel into unprecedented chaos.\n\n The whole country is in bunkers, everything is stopped, nothing works anymore.  It revealed Israel's weakness, mobilization potential, about 650,000 is the maximum they can mobilize.\n\n It revealed their military-technological potential, the reaction of the United States and showed the true face of Israel to the world, after they, out of rage and thoughtlessness, began to kill civilians and children in Gaza.\n\n Anyone who thinks Iran didn't know Israel might invade Gaza is wrong.  \n\nIsrael has already entered Gaza several times, the last time in 2014. So it is very likely that this is one of Iran's goals, to provoke Israel to invade Gaza.\n \nWith the entry in Gaza, the second round begins.  \n\nHezbollah will begin to constantly harass Israel, or it may become fully involved in the war and destabilize Israel gradually over many years.\n\n The question is how Hamas and Gaza will respond to the invasion, but judging by the readiness this time, Hamas likely has a huge stockpile of weapons that can do massive irreversible damage to the Israeli army and pave the way for the third round, which is a ground invasion of Israel from  side of Islamic paramilitary organizations throughout the Near East.\n \nThe US will certainly intervene directly with boots on the ground if it comes to the third phase, but that too is very predictable and most likely part of the plan, a final proxy war against the US, following the same recipe they are using.",

    "text": "Apa yang bisa dilakukan oleh paralayang bermotor di hadapan salah satu militer paling tangguh di dunia?\n\n Tampaknya sebagian besar berada di tangan perlawanan inovatif Palestina, yang pada Sabtu pagi melancarkan serangan mendadak terhadap Israel melalui udara, darat dan laut.  Seperti yang diperlihatkan dalam video yang menakjubkan, paralayang ini telah menjadi angkatan udara perlawanan Palestina.\n\n Operasi Badai Al-Aqsa, serangan besar-besaran yang dipimpin Hamas pada 7 Oktober, tidak diharapkan oleh siapa pun.\n\n Hal ini terjadi sebagai pembalasan atas pogrom Israel yang sedang berlangsung di kota Huwwara dan Yerusalem di Tepi Barat, terutama oleh pemukim yang menyerbu masjid al-Aqsa selama Hari Raya Agung Yahudi selama sebulan terakhir, belum lagi pengepungan yang sedang berlangsung terhadap Gaza selama lebih dari 10 tahun.  satu setengah dekade.\n\n Konsensus dari banyak komentator media Arab adalah bahwa perlawanan tersebut telah secara efektif menghapuskan mitos kekuatan militer Israel dan reputasi buruk aparat intelijennya, yang kegagalannya – dilihat dari keberhasilan serangan Palestina yang mengejutkan – sangatlah mengejutkan.\n\n Yang tidak kalah mengejutkan adalah pengambilalihan beberapa koloni pemukim Israel di dekat perbatasan Gaza dan bahkan sejauh 22 km oleh perlawanan Palestina, seperti dalam kasus Ofakim.\n\n Mungkin pencapaian besar perlawanan dalam pengambilalihan sementara koloni-koloni pemukim ini adalah pukulan mematikan terhadap kepercayaan yang dimiliki penjajah Israel terhadap militer mereka dan kemampuannya untuk melindungi mereka.\n\n Laporan segera muncul bahwa ribuan warga Israel melarikan diri melalui gurun dengan berjalan kaki untuk menghindari serangan roket dan tembakan, dan banyak yang masih bersembunyi di dalam pemukiman lebih dari 24 jam setelah serangan perlawanan.\n\n Mereka yang belum melarikan diri dievakuasi oleh tentara dari lebih dari dua lusin koloni di dekat Gaza.",

They are the sisters of Saleh Al-Arouri, prominent leader of the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement in the West Bank and outside Palestine. \n\nBoth women have been imprisoned since January 2024, after they were kidnapped from their homes in Ramallah, during West Bank raids by invading US-sponsored Zionist occupation forces, days after the assassination of their brother in Lebanon by occupation forces.\n\nA few days before his sister's arrest, on January 2nd, Saleh Al-Arouri and 6 others were martyred by the occupation in a drone strike in a suburb of Beirut. Saleh had been deported from Palestine by the occupation in 2010 and, after many relocations, he settled in Lebanon in 2015. \n\nAfter her brother's martyrdom, right before being arrested, Dalal gave an interview in which she said: \"There is a reason for everything. The assassination of Saleh will not deter the Palestinian people from their struggle and will not break the resistance. New leaders will emerge.\", continuing with: \"[...]his blood, like the blood of the rest of the martyrs, is not more precious than the blood of the people of Gaza.\"\n\nToday, Alaa, Fatima and Dalal are liberated by the Resistance in Toufan al-Ahrar!",

This is not the entire reach of the Flood of the Free; especially as many of the leadership prisoners and those with high sentences are expected to be demanded to be released in the second stage of the exchange, in return for high-ranking Zionist captives held by the resistance. \n\nThe names on the list published by the occupation are exciting and inspiring, including so many of the great leaders of the Palestinian liberation struggle; three of the heroes of the Freedom Tunnel; Nael Barghouthi, the longest-held Palestinian prisoner; Mohammed Abu Warda, with 45 life sentences; Khalida Jarrar, the leading Palestinian academic and leftist; Ammar al-Zaben, the first Palestinian prisoner to conceive a child through \"smuggled sperm;\" Dirar al-Sisi, the Palestinian engineer kidnapped from Ukraine in 2011; Hadeel Shatara, the Palestinian educator and activist;  Iyad Jaradat, who endured years in solitary confinement; Wael Jaghoub, the Palestinian leader and writer behind bars; Bushra al-Taweel, the tireless chronicler of the Palestinian prisoners' cause; the ill strugglers like Moatassem Raddad and Mansour Muqtada; Abla Sa'adat, the wife of Ahmad Sa'adat — and so many more. \n\nHowever, we also know that the exchange will be completed in stages and throughout the 42 days, and that the Resistance — the great Resistance that achieved their liberation — is the only trustworthy source of information, and will be coordinating the release of the lists of names of prisoners to be exchanged each day of the releases. \n\nWe will provide immediate translations and information as soon as they are available on an ongoing basis. \n\n1,737 male and female prisoners will be released from Israeli occupation prisons by the Resistance as part of the FIRST PHASE ONLY of the Flood of the Free. \n\nWe urge everyone, around the world, to join with the Palestinian people in Gaza and everywhere, to celebrate the achievements of the Resistance and the humiliation of the occupier, and to celebrate and welcome each liberated prisoner as the heroes of our global movement that they are, in public events, with posters and public education, with actions and events exposing Zionism and imperialism everywhere. Receive the prisoners virtually and symbolically — and pledge to continue the movement until all of them are free, and all of Palestine is free, from the river to the sea.",

We will remain the loyal shield for the blood of our people. We have presented the best of our leaders and founders and we are still presenting in this blessed line of steadfastness and liberation.

We believe that the message has reached the enemy and its followers, and that what they saw today in Qabatiya and Qalqilya and before that in \"Tel Aviv\" is some of our might, and what is coming, God willing, is more terrible and bitter.\n\nSecond: We warn the zionist enemy against attempting to launch any aggression or broad attack on the cities of the West Bank or attempting to annex lands or fulfill any of the dreams of the extremists and leaders of its defeated army, and that any foolish step will be met with an immediate response of the blood of its leaders, soldiers and settlers, and the enemy has experienced us well.\n\nThird: Our battalions in the West Bank confirm that they are in a state of broad coordination with all the fighters of our people to coordinate and organize the state of resistance according to the requirements and circumstances of the field.**",

Their hidden agenda, however, was to liquidate the Palestinian cause, destroy Gaza, [punish](https://t.me/PalestineResist/15519) and displace its people, [crush our people’s aspiration for freedom, obliterate every shred of hope, and erase the legacy of the historic crossing of October 7.](https://t.me/PalestineResist/16964)\n\n**But the criminal occupation collided with the steadfastness of our people and their adherence to their land, failing to achieve any of its declared or hidden goals. Our people stood firm on their land, neither departing nor migrating, becoming the impenetrable shield for their resistance. **\n\nOur brave fighters from the Al-Qassam Brigades, those heroes who astonished the entire world with their extraordinary bravery and operations, stood steadfast until the very last moment of this war. They resisted with honor and ethics, both in defense and attack. They carried out unique operations with unparalleled courage and valor, planting explosives, launching missiles, setting ambushes, and engaging in close combat. They inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, turning the occupation’s machinery into charred coffins.\n\n**We salute all the fighters **[**from the heroic resistance factions,**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/18948)** especially the members of Saraya Al-Quds, our brothers in arms from Islamic Jihad. They exemplified the spirit of the free and sacrificial fighter, giving their lives willingly for the sake of Allah, their homeland, and the defense of their people.**\n\n**Today, we affirm that the occupation has not and will not defeat our people or their resistance, by the grace of Allah. **[**The occupation has achieved nothing**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/23349)** but destruction, devastation, and massacres against our people. It only secured its captives through an agreement with the resistance to stop the war and aggression, along with an honorable prisoner exchange deal.**\n\nWe say with confidence and certainty: The [steadfastness of our people,](https://t.me/PalestineResist/24507) their immense sacrifices, and the bravery of their resistance have thwarted and failed the occupation’s declared and hidden goals for this war. Our people’s will remains free, unyielding, and pure, untouched by betrayal or weakness. Instead, they have remained proud and resilient to the last moment, by Allah’s grace.\n\nTo our loyal and giving people… as we announce the achievement of a ceasefire and the end of the aggression, we extend all words of gratitude and appreciation to everyone who stood by us, our people, and our resistance during the harsh moments.\n\n**We particularly mention here **[**our brothers on the support fronts in Lebanon,**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/50659)** especially **[**the brothers in Hezbollah,**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/61568)** who have offered hundreds of martyrs from among their leaders and fighters on the path to Al-Quds, led by **[**His Eminence Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/61240)** and his leadership team.**\n\nWe also remember the support of our brothers in the Islamic Group and the great resistance, sacrifices, and immense patience shown by the Lebanese people in defense and solidarity with our Palestinian people. They fought valiantly, turning the life of the occupation into hell and displacement, in a true scene of solidarity and support that embodies the brotherhood of Islam and Arab unity.",

Oh, great people of Gaza! Oh, noble people of Gaza! Oh, the families of martyrs, the wounded, the prisoners, and the missing! You who kept your promises, endured unparalleled pain, faced unprecedented trials, and [upheld the trust placed in you with full faith.](https://t.me/PalestineResist/17478) You have sacrificed when sacrifice was called for, given when giving was demanded, had patience in times of hardship, and fought in the battlegrounds of jihad. By Allah’s will, you have attained the highest honor.\n\nCongratulations on your [steadfastness,](https://t.me/PalestineResist/22635) [struggle,](https://t.me/PalestineResist/40344) [patience,](https://t.me/PalestineResist/15657) [giving,](https://t.me/PalestineResist/59763) and [sacrifices.](https://t.me/PalestineResist/24600) \"Peace be upon you for what you patiently endured. And excellent is the final home.\"\n\nAt this moment, we stand in reverence and salute the caravans of martyrs—children, women, the elderly, scholars, fighters, doctors, journalists, civil defense personnel, security forces, government officials, police, tribal leaders, and families.\n\n**We honor all who ascended in the noblest battle for the greatest cause—the defense of Al-Quds and Al-Aqsa in Al-Aqsa Flood. A salute to those who remained steadfast in their promise, carried on the mission, and held the banner high after them. **\n**\nWe stand in awe before the martyred leaders whose bodies were torn apart in this battle:\n- Martyr Leader **[**Ismail Haniyeh**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/51032)** (Abu Al-Abd)\n- Martyr Leader **[**Yahya Sinwar**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/63239)** (Abu Ibrahim)\n- Martyr Leader **[**Saleh Al-Arouri**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/25328)** (Abu Mohammed)\nAnd all our brothers in the political and military leadership of the movement in Gaza.**\n\nWe also honor the martyrs of all resisting and fighting factions, excluding none. To them and to our people, we declare: Your trade is profitable, O our leaders and martyrs, by Allah’s will. This is a trade with Allah that will never fail, and we will continue along the path of our martyred leaders [until victory or martyrdom,](https://t.me/PalestineResist/20218) by Allah’s will.\n\nThe [Al-Aqsa Flood operation](https://t.me/PalestineResist/31928) has marked a significant turning point in the history of our cause and the stages of our people's great resistance. Its effects will continue and will not end with the conclusion of this war.\n\n**What occurred on October 7th was a miraculous and unprecedented military and security achievement, carried out by the elite forces of the Al-Qassam Brigades. It will remain a source of pride for our people and our resistance, passed down from generation to generation. It struck the enemy’s entity at its core, and our people will regain all their rights. This occupation will soon be expelled from our land, Al-Quds, and our sanctities, by Allah’s will.**\n\n**The genocidal and barbaric war, Nazi crimes, and inhumanity perpetrated by the occupation and its supporters over 467 days will forever be etched in the memory of our people and the world as the most heinous genocide of the modern era, embodying all forms of pain, suffering, and hardship.** \n\n**The chapters of the genocide will remain a stain of shame on the forehead of humanity and the silent, complicit world. Our people will never forget everyone who participated in the genocide, whether by providing political and media cover or by supplying thousands of tons of bombs and explosives dropped on the heads of our people in Gaza. We affirm that all these criminals will face justice for their actions, even if after some time.**\n\nDespite the horrors and hardships our people endured—trials that turn children’s hair [gray—we hold our heads high with pride in our resistance, our heroes, and our steadfast people.](https://t.me/PalestineResist/32749) Our enemy will never see a moment of weakness or defeat from us.",

    "text": "Those who speak in the name of the sovereignty of this country are those who stand against the Resistance essentially. Most of the recent events prove that the Resistance is the only sovereign party that truly acts for the benefit of the country alone, not external parties. The Resistance has proven to have the needed insight to balance between regional events and national benefit. While supporting Gaza, it also defended Lebanon, and now, internally, the Resistance expressed its willingness to cooperate for the benefit of the country in word and action.\n\nThe election of the current president is certainly no win for the Resistance for several reasons: Hezbollah had expressed their refusal to vote for Joseph Aoun, who is close to the US, and insisted on their candidate, Frangieh, who is a close ally of the Resistance. Due to extensive pressure from external parties (headed by the US), it was clear that Frangieh had no luck at all. If Hezbollah wanted a president in the country, they had to compromise. However, Hezbollah and the Amal Movement (together nicknamed the Shia Duo in Lebanon) set their conditions to vote for Aoun to earn certain benefits in the coming governmental cabinet, in addition to guarantees related to rebuilding the areas affected by the war and establishing a defense strategy for the country. Hezbollah was not able to decisively choose a candidate for the presidency, but the Shia Duo was able to come out without complete loss from the situation.\n\nAoun has been very close to the Americans, especially throughout the past years.\nUnder his leadership of the Lebanese Army, the army fought alongside Hezbollah in the Aarsal battle and liberated Lebanese land from the takfiri terrorist groups in 2017. The decision was taken by then-president Michel Aoun, and the battle had started before Joseph Aoun became Head of the Army.\nThe liberation of Aarsal and its surroundings was labeled as the second liberation after the first liberation of South Lebanon in 2000.\n\nThe election of a president of America's choice in Lebanon today is further proof that sovereignty here is a facade. This is why America seeks to \"defend democracy\" in other nations. This also stands as proof that democracy itself is a fraud, especially as the people of most nations have proven to be ignorant of their enemy and of where the benefit of their countries lies.\nMost of those who speak in the name of sovereignty in Lebanon are fools who insist on disarming the Resistance for the army to defend and liberate our lands, which it is incapable of doing. Today, these same parties also voted for the candidate the US, an external party, chose.\n\nWhat the future holds and what Joseph Aoun will do as the president of Lebanon, a position with very limited authority (which makes it almost symbolic), but still some authority, remains unknown. We cannot, however, build a nation when our definitions of sovereignty are very different, and when we do not have a common enemy. This is one of the many reasons why the Resistance remains a necessity, regardless of democracy and popular opinion.",

    "text": "**The Prisoners' Authority and The Prisoners' Club stressed again that the rate of increasing numbers of martyrs among prisoners and detainees will take a more dangerous turn as more time passes on the detention of thousands of prisoners and detainees in the occupation prisons, and their continued exposure to systematic crimes, most notably torture, starvation, assaults in all their forms, medical crimes, sexual assaults, and the deliberate imposition of conditions that lead to their infection with serious and contagious diseases, in addition to the policies of theft and deprivation - unprecedented in their level.\n\nThe Prisoners' Authority, The Prisoners' Club, and all relevant institutions held the occupation fully responsible for their martyrdom. They renewed their demands for the international human rights system to move forward in taking effective decisions to hold the occupation leaders accountable for the war crimes they continue to commit against our people, to impose sanctions on the occupation that would place it in a state of clear international isolation, restore the human rights system to its basic role for which it was created, and put an end to the terrifying state of helplessness that it has been subjected to in light of the war of extermination, as well as to end the state of exceptional immunity that the old colonial powers granted to the occupying \"state\" of \"israel\" as it is above accountability, judgment and punishment.\n\n- The number of prisoners in the occupation prisons who were recognized by the prison administration until the beginning of December is more than 10.300, while the crime of enforced disappearance continues to be imposed on hundreds of Gaza detainees in the camps affiliated with the occupation army.\n\n- Among the prisoners are 89 female prisoners, no less than 345 children, and 3.428 administrative detainees.\n\n[3/3]**",

    "text": "**🔴 Within 24 hours, five martyrs from Gaza were announced.\n🔴 The Prisoners' Authority and the Prisoners' Club announce the martyrdom of four detainees from Gaza.\n🔴 The Prisoners' Authority and the Prisoners' Club: The occupation is carrying out systematic liquidation and killing operations against prisoners and detainees in its prisons and camps.\n\n12-30-2024\n\nRamallah - The Prisoners' and Freed Prisoners' Affairs Authority and the Palestinian Prisoners' Club announced the martyrdom of four detainees from Gaza, one day after the announcement of the martyr Ashraf Abu Warda. The martyrs are: Mohammed Rashid Akka (44 years old), Samir Mahmoud Al-Kahlout (52 years old), Zuhair Omar Al-Sharif (58 years old), and Mohammed Anwar Labad (57 years old), bringing the number of martyrs announced during the past 24 hours to five martyrs.\n\nThe Prisonersx Authority and The Prisoners' Club noted that we received the news of Akka's martyrdom through the General Authority for Civil Affairs, while the family of the martyr Al-Kahlout received the news of his martyrdom through the Hamoked Foundation, the martyr Al-Sharif through a private lawyer who obtained a paper proving his martyrdom in Ramla Prison, and the martyr Labad through the Hamoked Foundation. \n\nThe Prisoners' Authority and The Prisoners' Club stated that all of these responses received by the various institutions were obtained from the occupation army or the occupation prison administration, and we confirm that this is the only available way to reveal the fate of the Gaza detainees that was made possible by the legal amendments. \n\nThe Prisoners' Authority and The Prisoners' Club explained that the martyr Akka was arrested on 11/15/2023 during his displacement from northern Gaza to the south. He's married and the father of ten children, and according to his family, he did not suffer from any health problems. He was ascended to martyrdom in the Negev Prison yesterday. \n\nAs for the martyr Al-Kahlout, he was arrested on 10/25/2024, from Kamal Adwan Hospital. Before his arrest, he had undergone an operation to remove parts of his liver and kidneys, and he needed intensive care. His health condition worsened due to the simple medical capabilities. Despite the doctors’ attempts to prevent the soldiers from arresting him, they arrested him by force, and he passed away on 11/3/2024, a week after his arrest. It is worth noting that he's married and the father of three children. \n\nThe martyr Al-Sharif has been detained since 10/7/2023, as he was arrested while working in the occupied territories in 1948. He's married and has six children. According to his family, he did not suffer from any health problems. He was martyred on 10/18/2023. Here, we point out that the occupation army is trying to manipulate the responses that followed the lawyer’s response, despite obtaining a paper confirming his martyrdom in Ramla prison. The process of manipulating the responses was represented by the army giving us another response stating that he had been released from Ofer prison, and another response stating that there were no authorities to give a response regarding his fate. This case is one of several cases that the institutions followed up on, which showed the occupation army’s deliberate manipulation of the responses.\n\nThe martyr Labad was arrested on 11/18/2024, during his displacement from the north to the south with his family. He is married and has eight children. Before his arrest, he suffered from liver cirrhosis and diabetes. He was ascended to martyrdom on 11/27/2024. \n\nThe Prisoners' Authority and the Prisoners' Club said that the increase in the number of martyred prisoners is an escalating humanitarian disaster, and a new confirmation of what we warned about, that the occupation, without the slightest regard for all of humanity, is working to liquidate prisoners in a systematic and public manner.**\n\n**[1/3]**",

    "text": "**In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\n\nStatement to the Palestinian people regarding the practices of the Authority in Jenin.\n\n⚫️ Issued by the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine:\n\nBased on the firm positions and solid principles upon which the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine was founded, and which it has adhered to throughout its journey, and which everyone near and far testifies that it has never deviated from,\n\nIn light of the unjust campaign targeting our movement, its cadres and symbols, with the aim of provoking it and dragging it into a cycle of rejected internal fighting,\nAnd based on our deep concern to abide by the will of our Palestinian people, as the owner of legitimacy and the final decision, we present to Palestinian public opinion the following facts:\n\nSince the launch of the security campaign carried out by the Authority's security forces in the Jenin camp, our movement has been subjected to a systematic media campaign aimed at distorting its path, casting doubt on its national affiliation, and denying its honorable history and great sacrifices. This campaign has reached the level of personal attacks on the movement's leaders and symbols. Despite all this, we affirm our adherence to refusing to be dragged into internal strife, not out of weakness or inability, but rather out of commitment to our principles, to preserve the blood of our people, and in appreciation of the sacrifices of the martyrs, wounded, and prisoners. We are fully aware that these provocations aim to drag us into the quagmire of strife, which we will not enter.\n\nOur brothers and sons in the Jenin Brigade have also been subjected, for weeks, to a fierce campaign of arrests, pursuits, and shooting, amidst a media and security siege aimed at undermining their resolve. These practices aim to push us into internal conflict, which only serves the zionist occupation that incites strife, aiming to portray our Palestinian people as being in a state of internal fighting, to pass its narrative and justify its crimes against Gaza before the world.\n\nFrom the first moment, we took the initiative to put forward numerous initiatives and mediations with the aim of sparing our people the scourge of strife and stopping the bloodshed. Despite our keenness to prevail wisdom, all these initiatives were thwarted, and the doors were closed to all peaceful solutions.\n\nEvents have taken a dangerous turn with the escalation of campaigns of repression and abuse practiced by the authorities against citizens who express their opinions rejecting sedition. These practices, which aim to silence voices calling for wisdom and reason, constitute a flagrant violation of freedom of expression and contradict the sanctity of Palestinian blood.\n\nBased on the above, we emphasize the following:\n1 - We demand that the Palestinian Authority immediately stop its security and media campaigns, lift the siege on Jenin camp, end the persecution of resistance fighters, and stop the abuse of citizens.\n2 - We commend the positions of our brothers in the Palestinian forces and factions who presented initiatives to lift the siege on Jenin and the efforts and endeavors they made to quell the strife and stop the bloodshed of our people, and to thwart the occupation, and we call on them to redouble their efforts.\n3 - We call on our brothers in the Fatah movement, with whom we share the path of struggle and resistance, to intervene urgently to stop the voices that insult their honorable history of struggle, and to redirect the compass towards our national unity.\n4 - We appeal to the dignitaries and national leaders, from various political and societal movements, to play their role in protecting Palestinian blood and working to find a way out that preserves the unity of our people.\nAs we address our people, we renew our firm commitment to preserving our national unity and our absolute rejection of all forms of sedition that serve the occupation alone.**",

    "text": "❗️Doron Kadosh - Israeli Army Radio correspondent:\n\n\"The rockets that were recently fired toward Jerusalem came from Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip, an area that has seen countless Israeli operations throughout the year. The rocket fire is interpreted as an attempt by the armed groups to empty their stockpiles before the army reaches them, especially after the start of the Nahal Brigade’s ground operation in the area. The army estimates that **Hamas still possesses a number of long-range rockets** capable of reaching Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. The surprising thing about this launch is that it did not come from the center of the Strip or Khan Yunis, but rather from **Beit Hanoun, an area where the army has been operating freely for a whole year, repeatedly destroying and dismantling its capabilities through repeated ground operations.**\"",

The occupation forces also booby-trapped a number of homes and blew them up in the vicinity of Sheikh Zayed Roundabout, Rawdat Al-Misbah, and the Beit Lahia Project.\n\nThis morning, about 30 people set off via Beit Lahia's main street accompanied by 3 ambulances heading to the Indonesian Hospital.\n\nIn Beit Lahia, warplanes launched two raids on the eastern areas, while Beit Hanoun has been witnessing violent air and ground shelling for two days that has not subsided at all.**",

It also occupied large swathes of the barrens of Arsal and Ras Baalbek in northern Lebanon, and carried out deadly attacks on Lebanese civilians. \n\nPrior to the formation of the Nusra Front in 2012, Julani was a member of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), the group which evolved into ISIS – also responsible for numerous atrocities in Lebanon.",

Their home, dreams, and livelihood were all destroyed. They lost everything, were displaced multiple times, and now, instead of living peacefully in their home, they find themselves in Deir al-Balah, enduring relentless bombing, fear, hunger, and devastation. Tragically, their family was bombed, leaving his mother injured and in urgent need of treatment abroad.\n\nThey are facing an immense crisis in southern Gaza, struggling with severe shortages of food and essential supplies. Aboud has a donation link to help save his family from this ongoing genocide. Any support you can offer, whether by contributing or sharing his story and campaign, could make a critical difference in their fight for survival.\n\nhttps://gofund.me/8308b5ba",

    "text": "**Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem Speech Highlights:**\n\n\n• What did the enemy achieve through its aggression on Lebanon? It assassinated Hezbollah leaders, including the martyr Sayyed, and committed heinous crimes against civilians. However, it failed to break the stronghold of the resistance, and its actions do not qualify as achievements.\n\n• The enemy has realized that a confrontation with Hezbollah is futile and will not lead to its victory, prompting it to resort to a ceasefire agreement.\n\n• We endured hundreds of Israeli violations during this period to facilitate the agreement's implementation, expose the enemy, and hold all of the concerned parties before their responsibilities.\n\n• In Hezbollah, we monitor developments and act according to our assessment of the interests and unfolding events.\n\n• The legitimacy of the resistance stems from its faith in its cause, regardless of its capabilities.\n\n• Victory lies in steadfastness and the continuity of this resistance.\n\n• Hezbollah's resistance continues with faith and preparation.\n\n• We do not know when the resistance will ultimately defeat this occupier. It sometimes wins and sometimes faces setbacks, but the essential aspect is its perseverance and presence on the battlefield.\n\n• Victory is maintaining the resistance and ignoring the discordant voices that reflect despair and reactionary behavior.\n\n• We say: come to a resistance that has proven its effectiveness and demonstrated that this enemy cannot withdraw except through resistance.\n\n• This aggression was stopped at the borders through the solidarity of our people and loved ones.\n\n• Every phase has its own methods and approaches; some changes occurred, but the key is for the resistance to endure.\n\n• The enemy is contemplating settlements in Gaza and the annexation of the West Bank, backed entirely by the US.\n\n• They have destroyed all the Syrian army’s capabilities under various pretexts, which clearly reflects their expansionist agenda, aiming to extend their reach to all Arab countries.\n\n• We must continue with the resistance, as it, alongside the army and the people, prevented the enemy’s expansion into Lebanon.\n\n• Hezbollah is strong and recovering from its wounds; those who hoped for its end have been disappointed.\n\n• Our upcoming agenda includes implementing the agreement south of the Litani River, reconstruction efforts, and electing a president.\n\n• We hope for cooperation between Syria and Lebanon governments and people.\n\n• As part of our agenda, we advocate for positive dialogue on contentious issues, including: \"What is Lebanon’s position on the Israeli occupation of its land? How do we strengthen the Lebanese army? What is Lebanon’s defense strategy?\"\n\n• We hope that the new ruling entity in Syria will regard \"Israel\" as an enemy.\n\n• The regime in Syria fell at the hands of new forces that we cannot judge until they stabilize, take clear positions, and regulate their situation.\n\n• Hezbollah has lost a military supply route in this phase, but this is a detail—we can explore alternative routes.\n\n• It is essential to reassess after these significant developments in the region, and we hope the outcomes will be positive.",

So fight the allies of Satan. Indeed, the plot of Satan has ever been weak. [An-Nisa:76]\nThis is the truth of Allah Almighty.\n\nWe mourn the martyrs of Jenin camp this morning at the hands of the security forces, may Allah have mercy on them.\n\nKill your anger before you harm your brother.\n\nKill your hatred before you destroy yourself.\n\nKill your ignorance before you destroy your society.\n\nKill your betrayal before your honor is violated.\n\nKill your selfishness before your pride is humiliated.\n\nKill your ego before you kill your homeland.\n\nOur final message to the sons of the security forces:\n\nThere is no traitor who was born a traitor, but he could easily become one if he was born and raised in a treacherous environment and was not rescued early by a free hand from this mire, for a traitor will not raise a son on freedom, loyalty and patriotism, and a free person will not raise his children on slavery and submission. \nTreason does not have to be a bullet that kills your brother, but merely accepting the oppressor - \"the occupier\" - and the reality he produced could be the starting point for treason.\n\nTo be free means to reject a reality imposed by your occupier, to stand against him and defend your freedom and fight for what you believe in, and if everyone lies, do not lie to yourself and kill in your soul the instinct and idea that you were born free. This will take you off the right path and cloud your mind and you will start to fall, and little by little you may find yourself not owning yourself, to become the king of your lie and their lie, defending your opponent and an opponent of what you should be, \"free\"!  In the end, you will die of your betrayal, and the idea remains clear, alive and fragrant.\n\nThe authorities must back down from their unpatriotic decisions that only serve the occupation. The blood of our martyrs is on your necks.\n\nYou will not be able to undermine our resolve or disarm us.\n\nOur fighting continues and our weapons are drawn in all arenas.\n\nYour brothers, Tulkarem fighters from all military factions.",

    "text": "**📌 European Reluctance to Arm Proxies: Yemen Isn’t Syria\n**\n__Rashid al-Haddad\n__\nIn a significant development, calls from supporters of the Saudi-Emirati coalition to escalate the Syrian scenario in Yemen have resurfaced, with factions such as the Al-Islah Party, Yemen’s Muslim Brotherhood affiliate, urging military action against Ansar Allah (Houthis). This reflects growing resistance to the UN-backed ceasefire and efforts to implement the Saudi-Sana’a peace roadmap agreed upon late last year. From Istanbul, the “Revolutionary Youth Council,” affiliated with Islah, explicitly called for military escalation, citing the Syrian experience as a model. These calls have exposed growing divisions within coalition-aligned factions, with the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) distancing itself from such initiatives.\n\nThe UN has reiterated the importance of preserving Yemen’s ceasefire and isolating it from regional conflicts. Ahead of a UN Security Council session, Special Envoy Hans Grundberg stressed the necessity of confidence-building measures to sustain peace and resume dialogue.\n\nOn the international stage, the EU rejected a new request from Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council for military support in securing Red Sea navigation, underscoring global consensus against a return to war. US envoy Tim Lenderking’s visits to Djibouti, Qatar, and Bahrain signal Washington’s intent to escalate tensions on Yemen’s western coast, particularly around Hudaydah, under the pretext of safeguarding international navigation and defending Israel amid Gaza’s ongoing crisis.\n\nIn response, Sana’a has escalated its military actions. It announced naval operations targeting US ships in the Gulf of Aden and airstrikes on Israeli territory. CENTCOM confirmed that Yemeni forces had recently targeted US naval fleets with ballistic missiles and drones, marking a significant escalation. Despite US efforts, skepticism remains over the ability of fractured coalition-aligned forces to carry out effective military campaigns.\n\nFull report in Arabic: https://al-akhbar.com/arab/815969",

He said that if anyone from our nation feels fear about anything in their life, they should reexamine their faith in God. For whoever truly believes in God cannot allow fear to infiltrate their heart.\n\nWe are the students of a journey founded on reliance upon God and submission to His will. We do not deviate from the truth by even a hair's breadth, and when God sees our sincerity, we achieve victory. Our sincerity is not evident only at the height of our triumphs; rather, true sincerity is revealed during trials and hardships. The greater the challenges, the fewer the truly sincere, patient, and steadfast remain.\n\nOur role as youth in this phase is to ensure that despair does not creep into our hearts and minds, no matter how harsh the circumstances. Moreover, we must foster this same resolve in those close to us, including family, friends, and relatives.\n\nI believe it is more essential now than ever that the youth of the nation channel all their energy and knowledge into supporting the resistance rather than seeking comfort, stability, or prioritizing individual pursuits over the collective good.\n\nNo matter how difficult the circumstances, we will endure, and we will prevail.",

Fortunately, there were no injuries inside the hospital at that time. Then, we were shocked when two individuals entered the hospital carrying loudspeakers and ordered me to evacuate all patients, displaced persons, and medical staff, forcing everyone into the hospital courtyard to be taken to the checkpoint. Later, they returned and demanded one escort per patient or displaced person to assist with the evacuation.\n\nIn the morning, we were horrified to see hundreds of bodies and injured people lying in the streets surrounding the hospital.\n\nThe hospital's oxygen generators were targeted during the night, leaving only two inexperienced surgeons available to operate on patients. Despite their limited expertise, they had to begin performing surgeries as there were 20 injured individuals requiring urgent care.\n\nHuman rights organizations and international institutions must act to save what can be saved from the repeated war crimes that have become a daily routine under the occupation.",

(2/2):\n—**\nThe zionist entity is an enemy to all Muslims, targeting Sunnis, Shias, and all Islamic sects and denominations.**\n\n**The enemies strive to fuel conflicts in Arab and Islamic countries, aiming to erase Palestine from the sphere of concern.**\n\nAt this critical moment, certain major Islamic regimes are seeking to demonstrate loyalty to Trump ahead of his return to the White House by stirring divisions within the nation.\n\n**The slogans of “liberating the Levant” should have been directed toward supporting the Palestinian people in their profound suffering and dire oppression.**\n\n**The holiest land in the Levant is Palestine, encompassing Al-Aqsa Mosque and Al-Quds. Why do those claiming to act under the banner of liberation, and their supporters, not move to liberate Palestine?**\n\n**The zionist enemy is the worst adversary of the nation. Is it not a priority to save the Palestinian people from zionist oppression and crimes?**\n\nSome regimes are seeking to appease Trump preemptively by destroying nations and serving the enemy’s interests, a deeply unfortunate trend.\n\n**The Islamic nation must not accept distractions that divert it from its vital, central cause—the plight of Palestine—which must remain a constant priority.\n**\nThe U.S. and \"israel\" aim to eliminate the Palestinian cause by diverting attention, targeting its supporters, and opening multiple fronts to exhaust the nation.\n\nDespite immense suffering, the fighters in Gaza continue their heroic operations with remarkable bravery, conducting ambushes, rocket attacks on settlements, and resistance in the West Bank.\n\n**This week saw joint operations by the Yemeni Armed Forces and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, targeting strategic zionist sites in northern and southern occupied Palestine, symbolizing unity in facing the common enemy.**\n\nUniting under Allah’s guidance and collaborating for righteousness is a sacred duty in Islam. I salute our brothers in the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, whose operations deeply trouble the zionist enemy.\n\n**Yemen’s support front carried out major operations this week, targeting occupied Yaffa, \"Ben Gurion\" airport, Asqalan, and conducting significant maritime strikes on U.S. warships, unsettling the enemy.**\n\nThe U.S. warships, under pressure, sought protection near Chinese vessels, drawing both mockery and surprise.\n\nPopular mobilization efforts, including training, military parades, and exercises, are vital. I urge everyone to join and acquire combat skills.\n\nFinally, I call on our people to participate in tomorrow’s mass demonstrations across the capital and provinces as planned.",

    "text": "🇾🇪 Ansarallah Commander Sayyed Abdulmalik Badr El-Din Al-Houthi delivered a speech today, December 5, 2024. Sayyed Al-Houthi spoke about the latest developments of the zionist aggression on Gaza and regional and international updates. \nRNN has provided translated highlights below (1/2):\n—\nAt the end of the second month of the second year, the enemy continues its brutal aggression in the Gaza Strip, committing crimes without pause.\n \nOver 25 massacres were committed by the enemy this week, resulting in nearly a thousand casualties among the Palestinian people, including crimes targeting displaced persons’ camps yesterday.\n\n**The toll of zionist aggression on Gaza to date exceeds 180,000 martyrs, wounded, missing persons, and captives.**\n\nThe Americans exploit wars against our nation, directly or through their proxies, to test their prohibited weapons and measure their effectiveness in exterminating people.\n\n**The enemy continues to use starvation as a tool of extermination, with UNRWA confirming that aid entering Gaza amounts to only 6% of the population’s needs.**\n\nThe enemy’s crimes persist in the West Bank against the Palestinian people, alongside attacks on Islamic holy sites.\n\nAmong the worst and most dangerous zionist crimes violating the sanctity of Islamic holy sites is the desecration of the Holy Quran.\n\nThe United States is the other face of zionism, with similar criminal practices shared between America and “israel.”\n\nThe presence of zionist captives in Gaza is a major issue the U.S. cannot tolerate, as it seeks to ensure that this nation remains subjugated to the zionist enemy.\n\nThe Islamic nation must learn from events, draw lessons, and deepen its awareness and understanding of what is happening and the threats it faces.\n\nThe enemies strive to make our nation forget or overlook the truths about them and to manipulate it with misleading narratives and lies.\n\n**The nation must firmly believe in the truth of the Quran, “Falsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it” (Quran 41:42), and classify its enemies in light of its teachings.**\n\n**It is deeply troubling that some within our nation rely on the Americans and zionists to dictate who they should consider an enemy.**\n\nAnother evident reality during this zionist aggression has been the severe neglect and abdication of responsibility by much of the Islamic nation.\n\nFor over a year and two months, most Muslims have been mere spectators, taking no practical action whatsoever against the zionist enemy.\n\nSome non-Muslim countries in Latin America have taken stronger stances against the zionist enemy than many Muslim-majority countries, which is deeply regrettable.\n\n**Major Arab and Islamic nations have stood by idly in the face of events in Palestine, offering little beyond statements and declarations without practical measures.\n\nArab summits produce no more than statements and declarations that have no lasting impact or actionable follow-up.\n\nArab and Islamic regimes have not allowed their peoples to mobilize in support of the Palestinian people; instead, they have restricted and suppressed them.\n**\n**The sole glimmer of hope amidst the darkness of Arab and Islamic betrayal lies in the efforts of the Al-Quds axis, jihad, and resistance.\n\nHezbollah has sacrificed immensely for the sake of Palestine, offering its leaders and cadres as martyrs in the path of Allah, achieving what others have not.\n\nThe support coming from Yemen and Iraq is evident against the backdrop of the immense Arab and Islamic abandonment.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran provides support and assistance to the entire axis, with the Palestinian people at the forefront.**\n\nCertain Arab media outlets actively undermine support for the Palestinian people, discouraging the nation from taking any action.\n\nThose aligned with America and “israel” are required to ensure no support reaches the Palestinian people or their fighters.\n\n**The efforts of the jihad and Al-Quds axis embody cooperation and solidarity among the nation’s members, uniting against the common enemy of all Muslims.**",

    "text": "Every time there is a serious effort towards Palestinian unity to confront the occupation, in line with the needs of the people -- and, therefore, with the Resistance -- Palestinian Authority \"security coordination\" forces, in league with the Zionist occupiers, launch arrests and attacks against the Palestinian resistance.\n\nAs Palestinian factions meet in Cairo, the PA in Ramallah is -- as it always has been since its creation under the Oslo accords -- arresting Palestinians under \"security coordination\" with the occupation, shooting at resistance fighters and dismantling resistance weapons.\n\nThis aims to prevent the resistance in the West Bank from carrying out a large-scale confrontation of the occupation, standing with Gaza and the people throughout Palestine, and from defending their land and people from colonial settlers. Of course, it also aims to prevent Palestinian unity.\n\nThis morning, PA \"security\" forces abducted Raheeb and Mohammed Daraghmeh (photos 1 and 2) after besieging their homes in Al-Jisr neighbourhood in Tubas, part of the PA's ongoing attacks on the resistance in Tubas and its popular cradle (acting alongside Zionist assassinations and invasions.) This has involved repeatedly dismantling explosive devices created by the resistance in order to confront the invading occupation forces and multiple threats against the resistance.\n\nFor Palestinian students, the PA prisons are a \"revolving door\" with the occupation. When released by the occupation, they are detained by the PA; and vice versa. At least four of the students arrested in the past week by the occupation were recently detained in the Palestinian Authority's notorious jails. Yesterday, the PA \"security\" abducted Birzeit student Hudhayfa Ammar Abu Zneid from his university dorm. (photo 3)\n\nOne day before, the PA intelligence services in al-Khalil abducted Polytechnic University student Muhannad Mahmoud Amr (photo 4), from Dura, after summoning him for interrogation at the Al-Khalil PA intelligence headquarters.\n\nPA intelligence forces abducted Imad Abu al-Haija, the liberated prisoner, the son of the imprisoned leader Jamal Abu al-Haija, brother of the martyr Hamza Abu al-Haija, and brother of the prisoners Asem and Abdel-Salam Abu al-Haija, yesterday. (photo 5)\n\nPA \"security\" forces (who provide security only for the occupation) arrested Palestinian journalist Hammam Attili (photo 6) from his workplace in Attil, north of Tulkarem, at the same time the zionist regime carries out an arrest and assassination campaign against Palestinian journalists.\n\nOnly two weeks after he was released from PA detention in Nablus, the PA once again abducted Rami Dweikat on 30 November. He has launched a hunger strike to demand his freedom. (photo 7)\n\nThese are only those most recently detained by the \"security forces.\" Since 7 October 2023, the PA has detained 1,800 Palestinians for \"security\" reasons — that is, suspicion of resisting the occupation, being held as political prisoners — while providing absolutely no security to the Palestinian people confronting violent illegal settlers and the occupation army on a daily basis.\n\nYesterday, the PA \"security forces\" attacked and opened fire on members of the Tulkarem Brigade of Saraya al-Quds in Tulkarem, who were able to escape. (The PA's forces previously assassinated Brigade martyrs Ahmed Abu al-Foul and Moatassem al-Arif.)\n\nOf course, this is nothing new. The Palestinian Authority was created in order to provide security for the colonizer and create a local agent to act in its interests, rather than to protect and liberate the Palestinian people.\n\nFrom Muhyi al-Din al Sharif to Ahmad Sa'adat to today's detainees, the treacherous PA imprisoned many leaders of the resistance in order to serve the Zionist occupation and its imperialist backers in the US, EU, Canada, etc. Free all Palestinian prisoners in PA, Zionist & imperialist jails!",

It emphasized that this aggression, backed by the Turkish regime, the U.S. administration, and the zionist entity, constitutes a violation of Syria’s national sovereignty. It described this as a reckless and miscalculated step by these terrorist organizations and their sponsors, who will fail to achieve their objectives in Syria, just as they have failed in Palestine and Lebanon.\n\nThe statement expressed the solidarity of the Palestinian Resistance Forces Alliance with Syria, which has thwarted the \"New Middle East\" plan since 2011. It highlighted that the Syrian people, who have withstood all hostile attempts over the past 13 years, will not be broken by the forces involved in the war against them regionally and internationally. Furthermore, it affirmed that Syria, with its people, army, and courageous leadership, will defeat this new aggression.\n—\nNote: The Palestinian Resistance Forces Alliance is a Damascus-based coalition of Palestinian factions. It includes Hamas, PIJ, PFLP-GC, Fatah Al-Intifada, PPSF, Al-Sa'iqa, PLF, and the Revolutionary Palestinian Communist Party. It is similar to the National and Islamic Forces in Palestine, but includes fewer factions.",

After discovering the presence of the special forces, the resistance fighters set out to besiege them. A large forces of the zionist occupation army estimated at 35 military vehicles stormed the camp and their army clashed with the resistance fighters, until their martyrdom. \n\nMartyr Mohammed Al-Saadi “Abu Al-Ayman\" was a prominent commander in Saraya Al-Quds - Jenin Brigade, the resistance movement he belonged since his early age. He was a close friend of the inspiring martyr Jamil Al-Amouri and grew up together with him to live the stories of heroism as a legacy that is difficult to lose. After the martyrdom of Jamil Al-Amouri, Abu Al-Ayman emerged as his friend’s blood guardian. He began taking more vital part in organizing the ranks and recruiting young men, as told by his friend to Al-Akhbar. \n\nAbu Al-Ayman was known for his simplicity and honesty. He expressed himself with the utmost simplicity (both in speech and personality) that can be understood by everyone, absolute humility and high morale. Everyone loved him because he was a true leader. Within two years of his leadership in the camp, zionist occupation army placed him on the wanted list. He was also a freed prisoner after three years of detention, survived several assassination attempts and was wounded three times with various injuries. \n\nIn the movement, martyr Mohammed Al-Saadi was more than a Field Commander, he also served as a bridge. He was a listener and delivered the concern of every internal problem to unifying social figures who would be creative in solving it. After that, he would intervene in his cheerful, brotherly style, to restore cohesion between the people.\n\nAnother beautiful story about him was the martyr Abu Al-Ayman as a dutiful son to his father. His friend said, \n\"I have not found anyone more dutiful to his father than him, nor more compassionate to his family than him. He was afflicted with the loss of his father after his father was diagnosed with cancer two years ago, and his resistance work did not distract him from taking care of him. He would return home in the middle of the night several times to kiss his father’s hands.\"\n\nGlory to the martyrs. 🖤🌹\n\n*Media 5 from RNN, **[**original link here**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/10607)[**.\n\n**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/2167)***Media 6 from RNN, **[**original link here**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/2167)**.**",

And when we are martyred, we win.”**\n— His Eminence, the martyred Secretary-General of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, may Allah be pleased with him.\n\nThousands have gathered at the __Light from Light__ event to bid farewell to their beloved leader, the Sayyed of the nation’s martyrs, His Eminence, the martyr, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. With hearts heavy with grief yet filled with pride and the deepest of love, the masses raise candles, hold his pictures high, and chant slogans of loyalty and resistance. The flag of victory waves as they converge on the site of his ascension to martyrdom in Haret Hriek, in Beirut’s Dahyeh (southern suburb).\n\nAl-Mayadeen correspondent Ali Mortada reported (media 6):\n\"In front of you on your screens, to the whole world and every viewer of Al-Mayadeen, are these people who have lost their homes, lost their siblings, lost their families, lost their livelihoods, lost their mothers, and lost their brothers. These are the people whom the enemy expected to break. Today, they stand at the site of the martyrdom of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah to say to him: __As you always promised us, O Sayyed, with constant victory, here we are fulfilling your promise. We came with victory once again, and again, and again.__\n\nThere is no message today greater than the spirit of the Sayyed, which flows here among us. We hear his words with both ears, and we see this soil, mixed with his blood, protecting us.\n\nHere rose the martyr of the nation; here rose the great, global leader and fighter. Here rose the leader who laid out Lebanon’s liberation since 1982, through the battle of ’93, through the battle of ’96, through the victory of 2000 and the liberation, through the victory of 2006, and through the victory of 2024.\n\nHere, the spirit of the man who guided us on the path to freedom ascended. Here, he listens to us and is present among us as we chant: __At your service, at your service, O Nasrallah!__”\n\nThe loss is immense, yet we are reminded of the Sayyed’s enduring faith in Allah, who grants victory to the steadfast and his faith in the masses—those who refuse to lower the banner of justice and liberation, no matter the cost. Today, though orphaned by his absence, they remain on the path he paved, the path of sacrifice, dignity, and resistance, marching towards Al-Quds.\n\nGlory to the eternal martyr, the Sayyed of the martyrs, His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. His blood will not be in vain, for it has sown the seeds of a great victory in every heart and every step toward liberation.",

The timing of the attack's launch undeniably proves that the terrorist groups are operating under the orders of the occupation forces. It has become evident that the failure of the project to undermine the resistance has driven the enemy to seek compensation on the Syrian front, which is integrally linked to the fronts of southern Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank.\n\nThe Party considers that this scheme will face the same fate as the aggression on Gaza and Lebanon. It further stresses that the involvement of both Turkey and the zionist entity in what is happening reveals that the position of the Syrian state in support of the resistance continues to unsettle the enemies of the nation and weakens plans for division and colonization.",

He was born and raised in the Jenin refugee camp, where he always sought and wished for martyrdom. Everyone attested to his bravery. [He once said, \"The youth have high morale; we are going to be martyred on the land of this camp. Deliver this message to all the Jews.\"](https://t.me/PalestineResist/47395)\n\n**Mohammed was born into a family of fighters. **\n\nHis brother, Naeem, was martyred when he was young, and his cousin Zakaria is still imprisoned, while his cousin Dawood was martyred and was the one who gave Mohammed the nickname \"Al-Nish.\" Mohammed joined the resistance at the age of 15, crafting explosives and firing at occupation checkpoints. His family only learned of his involvement when he was first arrested.  \n\n**Mohammed was among the best of the youth.**\n\nHis family and the residents of the camp testify to that. His brother, Yousef, said: \"Mohammed was beloved, cheerful, and loved children.\"\nHis father, Jamal, added: \"He was a simple, always smiling person with good relations with his friends.\"\n\n**All of his friends shared his love for the homeland.  **\n\nThey were united by their devotion to the homeland and their struggle in its cause. Some walked in his funeral, while others were martyred alongside him, including the commander of the brigade, Wissam Hanoun, known as \"Abu Watan.\" Wissam once said that they had no time to sleep, spending most of their time preparing explosives and setting ambushes.\n\nThe occupation failed to break Mohammed's resilience. He was injured three times, yet each time he left the hospital, he immediately took up his weapon again. When he was assassinated, only a week had passed since his last injury. \n\n**\"We are going to be martyred on the land of this camp. Deliver this message to all the Jews.\"**\n—\nNotes: The status of Wissam Hanoun \"Abu Watan\" remains unclear as the [occupation courts are concealing his fate](https://t.me/PalestineResist/70198) and are not revealing wether he is in the occupation's prisons, or hospitals, or ascended as a martyr. This is a common cowardly tactic used by the occupation forces to psychologically oppress families. Glory to the martyrs and may all our prisoners return home safely.",

    "text": "🟡🟢 Hezbollah Secretary-General, Sheikh Naim Qassem delivered a speech today, November 29th, 2024. RNN has provided highlights below, followed by a subtitled version:\n—\nHezbollah stood firm on the frontlines and began targeting the enemy’s internal front, placing \"israel\" in a critical defensive position.\n\nDuring this war, the number of displaced in \"israel\" rose from 70,000 to hundreds of thousands.\n\nThe resistance proved its readiness, with Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah’s plans demonstrating effectiveness and accounting for all developments.  \n\nThe occupation relied on inciting internal strife among hosts, but this gamble failed due to cooperation between sects and factions.  \n\nThe legendary and sacrificial resilience of the fighters amazed the world, terrified the \"israeli army,\" and instilled despair in the enemy.  \n\nWe are facing a great victory as a result of this battle. The enemy failed to destroy Hezbollah or weaken the resistance and was forced to justify its failures to its public.  \n\nThe resistance has persisted and will continue. This victory belongs to all who contributed—through sacrifice, injury, prayer, words, or support.  \n\nThis victory is for every honorable and free person who supported the resistance and condemned \"israeli\" aggression.\n\nOur support for Palestine will not stop, and it will take various forms.\n\nThe enemy is surrounded by defeat. The ceasefire agreement is not a treaty or a new deal requiring state signatures but rather an implementation of Resolution 1701, focused on the area south of the Litani River.  \n\nThe agreement’s central focus today is on the area south of the Litani River and the withdrawal of the \"israeli army\" from all occupied areas.  \n\nHigh-level coordination between the resistance and the Lebanese army will ensure the agreement's execution.  \n\nNo one should bet on discord between Hezbollah and the army, as this agreement falls under Lebanese sovereignty.\n\nGratitude is extended to the resistance fighters who humiliated the enemy and faced it with legendary resilience.  \n\nGratitude is also given to the martyrs who paved the path to strength and dignity, rejecting humiliation and prioritizing resistance.  \n\nWe thank the Islamic Republic of Iran, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei for his guidance and support, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and the martyr Qassem Soleimani, who laid the foundation and built this path. Gratitude is also extended to the compassionate Iranian people.   \n\nThis victory in the Battle of the Mighty Ones surpasses the victory of July 2006.",

    "text": "**The Truth About Hezbollah in Syria**\n\nAfter the so-called \"Arab Spring\" swept across Arab nations, destabilizing them one by one and paving the way for normalization with \"israel,\" came the war on Syria—a battleground for one of the most ruthless propaganda wars in modern history. This was the first conflict to weaponize social media, exploiting it to deepen the divide between Shias and Sunnis and to fracture the unity between the Palestinian and Lebanese Resistance. \n\nSyria, the lifeline of the resistance’s weapons pipeline, was targeted for destruction. The fabricated narrative of \"Hezbollah’s crimes in Syria,\" heavily propagated by Gulf media, continues to serve as a tool to attack Hezbollah and the entire Axis of Resistance to this day.\n\nYou can learn more about this in [The Secrets of the Second Liberation.](https://t.me/secretsofliberation)",

They launched thousands of operations against the zionist entity, announcing 3,763 of them in official statements. They killed and wounded thousands of zionist soldiers, and displaced over 200,000 settlers in a bound towards the final liberation. The Lebanese resistance and its people sacrificed everything, from fighters to homes, men, women, children, and the martyr leader, Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Over 4,000 martyrs have ascended in Lebanon throughout the course of this war, among them 200 paramedics.\n\nAs this ceasefire takes effect, hundreds of thousands of displaced Lebanese are already returning to their homes. They will rebuild their homes, bury their martyrs, nurse their wounded, and nurture their children. Through their resistance, they have stood against the forces of evil in the world and lived to write the history of their historic deeds.\n\nThis is the future which we pray for for the oppressed Palestinian people, and which will be fulfilled in no small part thanks to the actions of Hezbollah in Lebanon. We thank the resistance for all it has offered in service of this righteous cause, knowing that our people remain united in spirit and will unite in Al-Quds under the banner of a liberated Palestine.\n\n\"And victory is not but from Allah, the Almighty, the Wise.\"",

Martyr Hamza Abu Haija, a leader in the Al-Qassam Brigades from Jenin camp, was martyred there on March 22, 2014. Three family members were injured during the incident. Despite the risks, the family has never wavered in supporting the resistance. \n\nOn March 7, 2023, the same house was besieged and bombarded with 16 missiles, resulting in the martyrdom of Abdelfattah Hussein Kharousha, a fighter from Askar camp, a member of Al-Qassam Brigades, and the executor of the Huwara operation at the time. Five other fighters were also martyred with him in that battle near and around the house: Ziyad Al-Zarini, Mohammed Wael Al-Ghazzawi, Mu’tasim Nasser Sabbagh, Ahmad Salim Khalouf, and Tariq Ziyad Mustafa Al-Natour.",

However, our people, with the unity and solidarity of its struggling and combating forces, will stand with all determination in defense of our hopes and national rights, in defense of our land, our sanctities, and our dignity.

In this context, we assure you that we look with all seriousness, depth, and sincerity, and will do our utmost to strengthen and consolidate the bonds of alliance, as well as joint work between our front and the struggling Hamas movement. As we offer our condolences to our people, we offer our condolences to you. We offer our condolences for the loss of this hero, and we renew our pledge to continue the struggle, no matter how long it takes, until our land, our people, and our Al-Quds are liberated from the filth of the occupation.\n\nIn the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\n\nAnd do not think that those who were killed in the cause of God are dead.

    "text": "📌 **\"Israels\" Northern Community Reels from Economic Paralysis** \n__Al-Akhbar report \n \n__The war’s toll on Israel’s northern regions has become a staggering economic burden. With damages exceeding 5 billion shekels ($1.35 billion), the Israeli Tax Authority warns that the figure will only climb without a ceasefire agreement with Lebanon. Direct damage to homes, factories, and infrastructure totals 1.5 billion shekels, while indirect losses—shuttered businesses, halted agriculture, and declining incomes—reach 4 billion shekels, with agriculture and tourism hardest hit. \n \nFactories near the border are closed, and major shipping disruptions have choked supply chains, crippling production. Even in areas farther from the frontlines, workforces have dwindled, operating at barely 50% capacity as missile strikes and sirens disrupt daily life. Over 27 settlements have ceased operations entirely, following Hezbollah's evacuation warnings three weeks ago. \n \nIn a blow to Israel's defense industry, precision strikes by Hezbollah drones forced the closure of key military factories, including facilities belonging to \"B.A.T\" and \"Rafael\". These attacks have led to layoffs, factory relocations, and the evacuation of sensitive military sites. The once-bustling real estate market has collapsed, with plummeting demand and over 12,000 families displaced, many now facing up to 18 months in temporary housing.  \n \nInterviews with Israeli business owners impacted in the northern regions under occupation emphasized their recognition of the \"need for joint cooperation with the Arab community\" in these areas. These regions are home to over two million people, including approximately 850,000 Arabs who form a vital part of the business and production sectors and a significant consumer base. \n \nThe war’s shadow continues to freeze reconstruction, deepen unemployment, and strain resources, threatening to lock the northern economy in paralysis for the foreseeable future. \n \n__Full report in Arabic: ____https://www.al-akhbar.com/Lebanon/387873__",

It practices all forms of genocide, including ethnic cleansing, forced displacement, starvation, complete siege, and horrific massacres carried out daily against families in their homes and displaced persons in shelters. These actions aim to force residents off their land in execution of the criminal plan known as the \"Generals' Plan.\"  \n\nWe, in the Media Office of Hamas, urge you to persist in focusing your media coverage on the events in the northern Gaza Strip, redoubling your efforts, and intensifying the transmission of the escalating humanitarian tragedy, the horrific massacres, and the inhumane starvation campaign being inflicted on innocent, unarmed civilians by the criminal occupier. This is an act of revenge and punishment against them for their resilience on their land and their thwarting of the nazi occupation's plans to eradicate our national cause. \n\nFurthermore, we call on the masses of our Palestinian people, our Arab and Islamic nation, and freedom-loving people around the world to continue and escalate their solidarity activities, including marches, sit-ins, and blockades of occupation embassies and those of its supporters. We stress the importance of media attention in covering these activities, which are being held in various cities and capitals across the globe.",

Some of them have fulfilled their vow, and some are still waiting, and they have not changed in the least.\"  \nThis is the Truth of Allah the Almighty.\n\nWe mourn to the nation of resistance and resistance media, the nation of martyrs and fighters, a great media leader and a great martyr on the path to Al-Quds, [Hajj Mohammed Afif al-Nabulsi](https://t.me/PalestineResist/68831), the head of media relations in Hezbollah, who departed to be with his Lord with the best of his fighter brothers in a criminal and aggressive zionist airstrike, after an honorable journey in the arenas of jihad and resistance media work.\n\nHajj Muhammad Afif joined, as he long to, his comrades-in-arms, his beloved and his \"father\" whom he loved to call by this name, the supreme martyr, [His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah](https://t.me/PalestineResist/66371). He derived strength from his wisdom, and vision, insight and light from his guidance. He was an example of a loyal brother, a strong supporter, a trustee of the voice of the resistance, and a fundamental pillar in Hezbollah’s media, political and jihadist march.\n\nHe was not intimidated by the enemy’s death threats, he faced them with great courage and his famous phrase: “The bombing did not scare us, so how can the threats scare us?” With his usual courage, he insisted on a bold media presence to confront the \"israeli\" media machine, convey the voice of the resistance and its position, and clearly outlined the features of the ongoing battle through his live appearances in the heart of the southern suburbs of Beirut.\n\nWith his brilliant, luminous pen and brave stances, he drew the letters of glory and victories, instilling horror in the hearts of the enemy. With the strings of his voice, he composed the melody of death for their [weak house](https://t.me/PalestineResist/6535). The rifle of his words struck them down, and his sword-like voice broke their tyranny. He conveyed what the [Karbalai](https://t.me/PalestineResist/62183) warriors were doing in the battlefield, and chronicled their epics in the media. He was truly the lion of the media field, and he was the one who loudly chanted in the ears and hearts of the enemy, saying: “Resistance is a nation, and a nation never dies.”\n\nWe offer our condolences to the Master of the Age and Time [Imam Mahdi], may Allah Almighty hasten his noble reappearance, to His Eminence the Guardian of the Muslims, may God protect him, to the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, [His Eminence Sheikh Naim Qassem](https://t.me/PalestineResist/65683), may Allah protect him, to his brothers, the fighters in the Islamic Resistance, and to his honorable, patient and steadfast family. We ask Allah Almighty to bestow upon them beautiful patience and reward in this world and the hereafter.\n\nHezbollah\nSunday 17-11-2024\n14 Jumada Al-Awwal 1446 AH",

    "text": "🚨 **__The Situation of the Female Prisoners as reported by __**[**__\"Qadeyah\"__**](https://t.me/qadeyah/13729)**__ and translated by RNN:__**\n**—**\nSince the beginning of the aggression, the female prisoners have endured compounded suffering due to the escalation of abuse and the denial of their most basic rights by the prison administration. This is in addition to the exploitation of their cases by some lawyers who have profited from them, whether by taking on their representation or facilitating visits.\n\n**The current situation summarized:**\n\n**- One change of clothing per prisoner:** The prison administration bargained with the prisoners by offering them a single winter outfit in exchange for confiscating their summer clothing. The outfit is of poor-quality fabric, shrinking with washing and fraying easily. Even a \"half needle\"—a broken needle the prisoners used to mend their clothing—was confiscated during one of last month's raids.\n\n**- Scarce and poor-quality food:** The administration continues to provide food that is both insufficient in quantity and substandard in quality, leading to issues such as constipation and hormonal imbalances among the prisoners.\n\n**- Sick prisoners without proper treatment:** The unbearable conditions of imprisonment for a healthy detainee are doubly harsh for those suffering from illnesses. There is no doctor to treat them nor appropriate medication. The jailers deliberately replace proper treatment with a single \"Acamol\" pill or sedative injections.\n\n**- Punishment for the simplest acts:** The prison administration punishes prisoners for minor actions such as delays in using the bathroom or even for laughing together as they try to lift their spirits through conversation or games. Punishments include being denied outdoor time for days, cell raids, strip searches, beatings, and confiscation of the few possessions they have left in their rooms.\n\n**- Deprived of cleaning supplies:** There is no laundry detergent available, only dish soap. They have had no nail clippers for nearly a month, and only one comb is available in the entire section. Some prisoners are now suffering from fungal infections on their skin and scalp due to these conditions.\n\n**- Exploitation by lawyers:** Since the beginning of the aggression and the suspension of family visits, some lawyers have exploited families by charging exorbitant amounts to facilitate visits with the prisoners. This is compounded by the poor treatment of some lawyers and their failure to deliver even simple messages between the prisoners and their families.\n\nThe suffering is indescribable, and the conditions are unbearable. **Yet, the prisoners, as one witness says, \"are incredibly strong.\" They draw their strength from their closeness to Allah, filling their days with prayer, recitation of the Quran, and fasting. They remain resilient, but this does not absolve every one of their duty to advocate for and support them.**",

Over 40 years, Afif was a fighter on the media front, notably in the 2006 war and in the Battle of the Mighty Ones, where his defiance shined in light of zionist threats.\n\nAl-Manar mourned him: **__\"A life spent on the path to Al-Quds, a voice boldly proclaiming resistance, a bright mind, a distinguished journalist, and now a blessed martyr. Many titles and roles embodied in one figure: an advisor, a director, a leader, and a media pioneer—he was, above all, Al-Hajj Mohammad Afif. One of the voices of resistance that will not be silenced by martyrdom but will grow stronger alongside the news from the battlefield. How could it not, when he echoed the bullets of the fighters, their rockets, drones, and achievements? He delivered these triumphs to the world from the steadfast podium, standing firm against the enemy's threats, promises of vengeance, and crimes.\"__**\n\n**__\"Yes, we know the cost is high, and the price is great, but victory is only an hour's patience,\" __**he said in a recent speech. \n\nA few weeks ago, he was giving a press conference in the Ghobeiri area of the southern suburbs of Beirut when the IOF sent a threat to bomb the area. He ended his speech, \"We will be victorious,\" and then was asked, \"Hajj Mohammed, what is your opinion about the 'israeli' threats that came during this press conference?\"\n\n**\"Bombing does not scare us. So how will threats scare us? Indeed, our will is unshakeable, our determination is strong, and our resistance is steadfast.\"**\n\nGlory to the martyrs.",

    "text": "#حكاية_زنازين\nBehind these walls, our women have been stripped of their freedom.\nIn the midst of silence and oppression, Palestinian female prisoners bear their suffering and pave the way for our freedom\n\nFrom within the depths of prison, Palestinian women’s stories of strength and resilience unfold amidst their endurance of the harshest forms of torture and deprivation. \n\nAmong them wounded women, children, and mothers deprived of their children. Palestinian prisoners endure unbearable suffering from the moment they are detained until their very last moment in prison. The suffering isn’t confined within the occupation’s prisons; on the contrary, the effects of the excruciating physical and mental torture remain with the freed prisoners long after their release.\n\nConsistent violations of their freedoms and sanctities, as the occupation forcibly removes the prisoners’ hijabs.\nAny attempt to invoke their right to refuse the removal of their hijab is met with barbarity and further forced naked searches. Occupation forces have not only confiscated Palestinian prisoners’ hijabs, but they have also confiscated any needles or threads to prevent prisoners from repairing the torn shoes and clothing that the occupation had replaced their modest attire with. Prisoners have no choice but to borrow each others’ shoes when they need them to go outside for breaks or to meet with their lawyers.\n\nSystematic medical neglect; the necessary medical care is not provided to any of the women inside the occupation’s prisons facing diseases, injuries, and mental ailments exacerbated inside the prison.\nThe hardest times, reported by many imprisoned women, are during pregnancy, where they are denied all necessary medical attention and even deprived of sunlight.\n\nPrison cells unfit for human habitation. Humidity, moldy walls, and blankets—if provided— that reek. This is how prisoners describe their rooms in which they are held.\nTorture is meticulously designed into every detail possible, where, in addition to the widespread insects and pests that spread diseases and infections, the lights are turned on and off at the whim of the occupation soldiers and guards, after cutting access to control them from inside the cells. \n\nA Palestinian prisoner describes her arrest: “My house was raided and I was detained by special forces a week after the start of the assault on Gaza. I was taken to a police station in my residential area while being threatened with execution or “deportation to Gaza” along with insults and intimidation tactics.” She was then transferred, her hands and feet shackled, to an isolated area, where she was subjected to shabah (a form of torture) under heavy rain alongside prisoners from Gaza, in a brutal and horrifying scene.\n\nTalking about the first hours inside Al-Damon prison, she says: “When I first entered, campaigns of repression and cell raids using batons and tear gas began, and all essential supplies that were previously available to prisoners including cooking utensils, electrical appliances, books, and more, were confiscated.” Based on what she was told by other prisoners, she added “Women are being detained in unprecedented numbers from across Palestine on a daily basis and at an increasingly rapid rate.”\n\nShe also mentioned the harsh circumstances and constant threats of rape that women from Gaza are experiencing. Many had been abducted from shelters and know nothing about their children or their whereabouts. One Palestinian prisoner from Gaza says, “I was abducted and I know nothing about my four-month-old baby, my heart is shattering with worry over him.”",

    "text": "**🚨 BREAKING: A French court approved the release of Georges Abdallah, the longest-held political prisoner in Europe—the internationalist, communist, fighter for liberation.**\n\nHe is set to be freed on **December 6th, 2024,** after recently reaching 40 years of imprisonment. His release is contingent upon him leaving France.\n\nFor four decades years, immense popular pressure has been directed on French, American, and European authorities to secure his freedom. Last summer, Georges submitted the ninth request for his release, as his minimum sentence ended in 1999. Despite this, American intervention repeatedly blocked his release. Notably, his eighth release request,** which was approved by the French judiciary in 2013**, would have seen his release, but was overturned by American pressure, absurdly arguing that that the 72-year-old man \"may return to the battlefield.\" It was revealed in 2015 that Hillary Clinton ordered French FM Fabius to keep Georges imprisoned in 2015. **In fact, Georges has been eligible for release since 1999, but the state fears his capacity to galvanize the masses.**\n\nGeorges, from his humble Lebanese village of Al-Qoubaiyat, he was inspired by the revolutionary broadcasts of the PFLP, and soon formed and led the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions (LARF). When the zionist enemy invaded Lebanon in 1982, he worked tirelessly to halt the supply of weapons from Europe to the zionist entity. He was arrested in 1984 under fabricated charges—French police claimed that weapons that were never present were found. By 1987, he was convicted for the alleged murder of a US Army officer and a zionist embassy official in Paris.\n\nGeorges neither confirmed nor denied the allegations. To him, the trial was a farce. **His position was clear: the French state and its authorities are complicit in the occupation of Lebanon and Palestine.** To him, the courts were theatrics, a tool of imperialism to obfuscate the complicity of the US and France in the bombing of his country. \n\nIn his own words:\n[**__\"Comrades, let us be vigilant and prevent the zionist criminals from annihilating the revolutionary heroes in captivity!\"__**](https://t.me/RNN_Prisoners/1096)\n**__\"Let us be worthy of the epic of the torches of freedom, those invincible resistance heroes detained in zionist prisons! Naturally, the popular Palestinian masses and their fighting vanguards in captivity can count on your active solidarity. May a thousand solidarity initiatives flourish for the sake of Palestine and its glorious resistance.\"__**\n**__\"Glory and eternity to the martyrs! Victory to the masses and the struggling peoples.\"\n\"__**[**__Yes to building a comprehensive Arab resistance front to confront normalization in all forms!__**](https://samidoun.net/2022/01/georges-abdallahs-message-to-the-international-week-of-solidarity-to-free-ahmad-saadat/)**__\"\n\"Down with imperialism and its agents, the zionists, and Arab reactionaries!\"\n\"__**[**__Together, Comrades, and only together will we win!__**](https://samidoun.net/2022/04/georges-abdallahs-statement-for-2-april-day-of-action/)**__\"__**\n\nLet us heed his words, remaining vigilant and committed to his vision for justice and liberation, for Georges and for all prisoners in zionist, western, and Arab reactionary prisons.\n#FreeThemAll",

Our steadfast and patient people in Gaza look to the masses of their nation and to the free people of the world to participate actively and to exert pressure by all means until the aggression ceases and the genocide ends.**\n\nThe Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)\nWednesday: 11 Jumada al-Awwal 1446 AH\nCorresponding to: November 13, 2024",

Our people possess the will and determination to respond to the occupation and to confront all of its aggressive actions against our women and prisoners.\n\nThe dire conditions that prisoners face inside the prisons, including daily arbitrary searches and deprivation of all basic necessities such as food, medicine, clothing, and blankets, aim at deliberate moral and physical harm, as confirmed by facts and statistics.\n\nWe call on all local and international human rights and legal organizations, especially those concerned with women’s issues, to pressure the occupation and curb its arbitrary practices against them.\n\nWe urge all national factions, popular movements, and our people and the families of the prisoners to escalate supportive activities for the prisoners and to support their cause by all available means until they achieve full freedom.\n\nThe Islamic Resistance Movement – Hamas\n\nWednesday: 4 Jumada al-Awwal 1446 AH\nCorresponding to: November 6, 2024",

    "text": "**Unknown Jordanian heroes:** \nDespite betrayal and normalization, the authentic sons of Jordan have proven that Al-Quds is in their hearts, whether by popular support, armed resistance (a series [operations](https://t.me/PalestineResist/63216), martyrs [Maher Al-Jazi](https://t.me/PalestineResist/63574), and [Hussam Abu Ghazaleh and Amer Qawas](https://t.me/PalestineResist/63714)), or resistance via other means. \n\nIn April 2023, Jordanian parliament member [Imad Al-Adwan](https://t.me/PalestineResist/6945) was arrested at the border of occupied Palestine under the pretext that he had[ 200 guns](https://t.me/PalestineResist/9083) and gold for the resistance in the West Bank. He reportedly successfully smuggled goods into Palestine a dozen times prior, and his arrest was carried out in coordination with Jordanian intelligence.\n\n**Today, we recall four other heroes in the prisons of the Jordanian regime:**\nJordanian citizens Hudhaifa Jaber, Ibrahim Jaber, and Khaled Al-Majdalawi were arrested a year and a half ago on charges of attempting to deliver weapons to the resistance in the northern West Bank, where resistance rages today.\nAhmad Ayesh, on the other hand, was arrested seven months ago for attempting to deliver advanced missile technology (Katyusha rockets) to the Palestinian resistance in the West Bank.\n\nThey have all been on trial in Jordan on charges related to \"terrorism,\" languishing in the horrific conditions of Jordanian prisons, just for exercising their just right and duty to support the resistance by any means amidst an existential genocide.\n\nRepression cannot stop the tide of liberation. Many have been arrested in Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, and Bahrain due to their support for resistance. Yesterday, Turkey arrested 16 activists who protested against the [MV Kathrin ship](https://t.me/PalestineResist/65779) carrying explosives for the IOF, while Bahrain has arrested 87 for their support of the resistance in Gaza and Lebanon. \n\n**Dozens of political prisoners remain in the jails of the Jordanian regime for their support of resistance, as do dozens of political prisoners in Palestinian Authority jails. Notably, families of these prisoners have called on the Palestinian resistance to include them in potential prisoner exchange deals.** #FreeThemAll",
