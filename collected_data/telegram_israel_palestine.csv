⭕ أبو عبيدة: ختامًا، يا أهلنا، يا شعبنا، كل الوفاء والتحية لكم، يا روح الثورة ومنبع الكرامة للأمة. إننا لا نزال الأحرص على وقف العدوان، فنحن منكم وإليكم، ولن نقبل سوى برفع الظلم عن أهلنا، وإن هذه المعركة المقدسة هي قدر كل الشعوب الواقعة تحت الاحتلال، ونتيجتها الحتمية هي انتصار الحق وقهر المحتلين مهما اندفعوا وطغوا وتجبروا.

⭕ أبو عبيدة: نطمئن مجاهدينا وشعبنا وأهلنا في كل أرضنا بأن طوفان الأقصى الذي بدأ من غزة، وما رافقه ويرافقه من أحداث وتطورات متلاحقة، هو من تلك المعارك التي لا تؤدي بإذن الله إلا إلى تغييرات كبيرة وتحولات استراتيجية قادمة، ستكونون فيها يا أهلنا أنتم صناع النصر وحملة لوائه بدماء شهدائكم الزكية ومعاناتكم الكبيرة وصبركم العظيم ورباطكم المبارك، وإن غدًا لناظره قريب، والله غالب على أمره ولكن أكثر الناس لا يعلمون، وإنه لجهاد نصر أو استشهاد.",1231.0,0.0,0,False
GazaNow,43,2024-07-07T16:04:25+00:00,"⭕ أبو عبيدة:  وفي المقابل، تلقى العدو ولا يزال جوابه من مجاهدينا ومقاومتنا في رفح قتلاً لجنوده وتدميراً لآلياته وكمائن لقواته، وبالتوازي، فإنه يتلقى الضربات الموجعة في كل مكان يتوغل فيه من جديد، في محور وسط القطاع، المسمى نيتساريم، الذي سيكون محورًا للموت والرعب بإذن الله لجنود العدو المحتلين، وسيخرج منه العدو مندحرًا كما خرج من قبل بقوة الله تعالى.

⭕ أبو عبيدة: إن قدرة مجاهدينا على القتال والصمود وإرادتهم لمواجهة هذا العدو باتت أكبر وأعظم بفضل الله، وإن نار الانتقام التي أشعلها العدو بجرائمه ونازيته وساديته كافية لحرقه وتدمير كل مخططاته بإذن الله. 

⭕ أبو عبيدة: سينشأ جيل فولاذي معبأ بإرادة المقاومة والقتال والتصدي للعدو، وهذا أكبر إخفاق استراتيجي للعدو سيدركه بعد حين.

⭕ أبو عبيدة: نؤكد أن القدرات البشرية لكتائب القسام بخير كبير بفضل الله تعالى، وقد تمكنا بعون الله خلال الحرب من تجنيد الآلاف من المجاهدين الجدد من صفوف الإسناد، وهناك آلاف آخرون مستعدون وبدافع كبير للالتحاق متى لزم الأمر.


⭕ أبو عبيدة: تمكن مجاهدونا بفضل الله من إعادة تأهيل وترميم بعض المقدرات  المهمة وتجهيز الأفخاخ والكمائن وتصنيع العبوات والقذائف، وإعادة تدوير عدد كبير من مخلفات العدو من قنابل ومتفجرات وصواريخ ألقاها العدو على أهلنا المدنيين بكثافة عالية جدًا وغير مسبوقة في تاريخ الحروب.

⭕ أبو عبيدة:  فقد عززنا المقدرات الدفاعية لمواجهة الاحتلال في كل مكان يتواجد فيه على أرضنا، ولا يزال لدينا الكثير لنقوله للعدو بإذن الله تعالى،  ""لِيَمْكُرُواْ فِيهَا ۖ وَمَا يَمْكُرُونَ إِلَّا بِأَنفُسِهِمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ"". 

⭕ أبو عبيدة: رسالتنا لجمهور العدو ولعائلات الجنود الصهاينة في غزة ولعائلات أسرى العدو، أنه بات معلومًا لديكم ولكل العالم أن النصر المطلق الذي يتحدث عنه نتنياهو هو انتصاره الشخصي في إقصاء خصومه وبقائه في السلطة في مقابل التضحية بأبنائكم. 

⭕ أبو عبيدة: وبالتالي فإن مصير أبنائكم يا جمهور العدو أصبح لعبة في يد رئيس حكومتكم ووزراء حكومته الصعاليك المهووسين بالتدمير والقتل، وأن كل ما يفعله نتنياهو هو محاولة للهروب من الحقيقة والإخفاق الذي سيلاحقه بقية حياته.

⭕ أبو عبيدة: ما كشف عنه مؤخرًا في أوساط العدو من وثائق استخبارية حول الفشل المدوي في السابع من أكتوبر هو أمر هين بالمقارنة مع ما سنكشف عنه في الوقت المناسب بإذن الله من وثائق ستكون أقسى وأصعب، تظهر كيف استطعنا تنفيذ خداع استراتيجي مركب لجهاز الشاباك والمنظومة الأمنية للعدو لسنوات.

⭕ أبو عبيدة: إن ما يجري من تصاعد مستمر لعمليات المقاومة في الضفة المحتلة في جنين وفي نابلس جبل النار، وفي كل محافظات الضفة والقدس المحتلة، هو رد وخيار شعبنا في مواجهة الإبادة الممنهجة والتهويد والاستيطان الذي تنفذه حكومة العدوان والإجرام. 

⭕ أبو عبيدة: وإن هذا الرد وهذه العمليات المباركة والنوعية لكافة فصائل المقاومة هو ما يليق بشعبنا المرابط الأبي، وهي أكبر رسالة لهذا العدو المتغطرس ولوزراء حكومته النازية، أن كابوس تحرك الضفة والقدس والخلايا الثائرة من الأرض المحتلة عام 48 قادم لا محالة، وبشكل لا يتوقعه العدو بإذن الله تعالى. 

⭕ أبو عبيدة: كل التحية لأبطال ضفتنا، وندعوهم لمواصلة سحق كبرياء هذا العدو المرتعد، ومواصلة عملياتهم وتصعيدها، فهم محط الآمال، وهم أهم حلقة في نهاية حلم هذا الكيان الغاصب.

⭕ أبو عبيدة: تحية واجبة نوجهها لإخواننا المقاومين الأبطال في حزب الله في لبنان الشقيق، ولمجاهدي الفصائل الفلسطينية والجماعة الإسلامية في لبنان ولشهدائهم، ولإخواننا أنصار الله في اليمن العظيم، وللمقاومة العراقية الحرة، والذين أبلغونا جميعًا باستمرار الإسناد الفعال والرفع المتواصل لسقف الرد حتى يتوقف العدوان على غزة.

⭕ أبو عبيدة: لقد لقنوا العدو دروسًا قاسية، وأعادوا للأمة أمل الوحدة في وجه العدوان والقدرة على حصاره وتركيعه، وأشعروه بأنه كيان غريب منبوذ بعد أن توحدت هذه الجبهات في نصرة القدس وغزة وفلسطين بالقول والفعل والقتال وبذل الدماء وشحذ السلاح وفرض التهجير على العدو، وحصاره بحرًا واختراق أجوائه وإرباك منظوماته الاستخبارية والأمنية

⭕ أبو عبيدة: إن ضمير أمتنا الجمعي بالتأكيد ينحاز لهذه المقاومة التي نصرت غزة بإرادة فولاذية وقتال بلا هوادة، فقد سئمت شعوب أمتنا التضامن اللفظي الخجول والعجز الرسمي المقيت.

⭕ أبو عبيدة: لقد حقق مقاتلو أمتنا الأوفياء مفهوم النصرة والوحدة العربية كما لم يحدث من قبل، فما أسعد روح شهيدنا عبد القادر الحسيني بكم يا أبطال أمتنا، وما أشد خيبة أمله من زعماء ناشدهم رحمه الله منذ 76 عامًا، ولا زال صدى صوته لا يحرك فيهم ساكنًا، بل إن عجزهم بات أكبر، وتقاعسهم وخذلانهم أصبح أشد وأقسى.",1094.0,0.0,0,False
GazaNow,42,2024-07-07T16:04:22+00:00,"*أبرز ما جاء في كلمة الناطق باسم كتائب الشهيد عز الدين القسام أبو عبيدة اليوم الأحد:*


⭕ أبو عبيدة: 9 شهور مضت منذ بدء معركة طوفان الأقصى في السابع من أكتوبر من العام الماضي، ولا يزال شعبنا يتعرض للعدوان النازي الصهيو أمريكي والإبادة الجماعية كعقاب له على تمسكه بأرضه ومقدساته وممارسته لحقه الطبيعي، بل واجبه في المقاومة لاسترداد حقوقه وطرد محتليه.

⭕ أبو عبيدة: 9 أشهر نذكر بعدها العالم أن طوفان الأقصى لم يكن بداية التاريخ لعملنا المقاوم ولا لعدوان الاحتلال، بل مثل الانفجار في وجه العدو لما سبقه من عقود قهر وظلم وطغيان من عصابات الصهيونية تجاه البشر والحجر والشجر والأرض والمقدسات.

⭕ أبو عبيدة: بلغت ذروة العدوان مع حكومة صهيونية يراها العالم اليوم تجاهر بعدم الاعتراف حتى بوجود شعب فلسطيني، وتمارس التطهير والإبادة الممنهجة في الضفة والقدس وفي غزة، وتحرض على الوجود الفلسطيني داخل فلسطين المحتلة عام 48. 

⭕ أبو عبيدة: إن فهم شعبنا لطبيعة هذه المعركة وعملية طوفان الأقصى هو ما تعكسه استطلاعات الرأي المستقلة التي أظهرت بعد شهور طويلة من العدوان كيف أن شعبنا في غزة والضفة يؤيد بشكل كاسح عملية طوفان الأقصى ويلتف حول مقاومته. 

⭕ أبو عبيدة: 9 أشهر وما كلت مقاومتنا ولا لانت ولا استكانت، إذ لا زلنا نقاتل في غزة بلا دعم ولا إمداد خارجي بالسلاح والعتاد، ولا زال شعبنا يصمد بلا غذاء ولا ماء ولا دواء وتحت حرب إبادة مجرمة ظالمة.

⭕ أبو عبيدة: تدخل غزة التاريخ من أوسع أبواب المجد كأعظم نموذج حرية عرفته البشرية في العصر الحديث وكمدرسة ملهمة لكل حر ومقاوم وإنسان في العالم.

⭕ أبو عبيدة: يا أهلنا، يا شعبنا، يا أمتنا، يا كل أحرار العالم، يقاتل مجاهدو شعبنا ومقاوموه قتالاً ملحمياً منذ تسعة شهور، ويثخنون في أهداف العدو ويقهرون جيشه المدجج بالسلاح والعتاد والمغطى بالنار من البر والبحر والجو والمدعوم من الولايات المتحدة وبريطانيا شركاء العدوان والإبادة.

⭕ أبو عبيدة: يقاتل مجاهدونا ببسالة ويخرجون للعدو كما توعدناه من اليوم الأول للعدوان، فيقتلون ويصيبون جنوده في كل يوم رغم طول أمد المعركة وبشاعة العدوان، ورغم أننا نقاتل الجيش الأكثر نذالة ودناءة ولا أخلاقية في العالم. 

⭕ أبو عبيدة: جيش يستخدم المدنيين دروعا بشرية ويوهمهم بمناطق آمنة ثم يقصفهم فيها، ويقصف البيوت المدنية على رؤوس ساكنيها، ويستبيح المشافي والمنظمات الدولية والمدارس ومراكز الإيواء المدنية ويتعمد تدمير الآثار والمناطق التاريخية والمساجد والكنائس والمقابر والمكتبات لأنه يخاف من التاريخ الذي يخبره أنه لا مستقبل للغزاة وأنه سيذهب إلى مزابل التاريخ.

⭕ أبو عبيدة: كل هذا يحدث على مرأى ومسمع من العالم وعلى شاشات البث المباشر ليرى العالم من خلال غزة أكذوبة المنظمات الدولية وعجز قوانين حقوق الإنسان المزعومة وعوار العدالة الدولية الانتقائية.

⭕ أبو عبيدة: مجاهدونا يقاتلون بكل صلابة ويبتدعون الوسائل والتكتيكات ويواجهون العدو بروح قتالية عظيمة وبإيمان منقطع النظير كأنهم من زمن صحابة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، ويجري الله على أيديهم من الكرامات والثبات ما يعجز اللسان عن وصفه، وصدق الله العظيم: ""والذين جاهدوا فينا لنهدينهم سبلنا وإن الله لمع المحسنين"".

⭕ أبو عبيدة: على مدار 9 أشهر كاملة، بفضل الله تعالى، قاتلت كل كتائبنا الأربع والعشرين وكل أسلحة الدعم القتالي من أقصى بيت حانون شمالاً إلى أقصى رفح جنوباً، ومعنا فصائل المقاومة إخوة ورفاق السلاح والجهاد.

⭕ أبو عبيدة: خاضت كتائبنا ملاحم وجولات متتالية ولا تزال، فكان أداء مجاهدينا في كل مرة يتقدم ويتطور ويتعاظم، بل يثخن مجاهدونا الجراح في العدو أكثر، ويستفيدون من تجاربهم في كل مرة، وقد قدمنا الشهداء الأبرار من الجنود والقادة من كافة المستويات، لكن الراية لا تسقط ولن تسقط بإذن الله تعالى وعونه. 

⭕ أبو عبيدة: ها هم مجاهدونا يقولون للعدو في كل يوم: ""لا مقام لكم في غزة الأبية، لا لناقلة النمر ولا لجنود مرتزقين مجهزين بأحدث تكنولوجيا حربية، ولا لمرتزقة يقاتلون بالأجرة في معركة خاسرة، ولا لقوات تتحصن في البيوت كاللصوص، ولا لضباط يختبئون خلف المدرعات، كلهم سيرحل قتيلاً أو مصاباً أو هارباً مذعوراً بإذن الله تعالى"".

⭕ أبو عبيدة:  معركة رفح الجارية منذ نحو شهرين والتي يقدم فيها مجاهدونا بكل بسالة، وما يسطره مجاهدونا أيضاً منذ نحو أسبوعين في الشجاعية، وما رافق هذه العمليات من معارك مشتعلة في شمال القطاع ووسطه وجنوبه، فهو أكبر دليل على بأس مقاومتنا وعنفوانها وعلى فشل العدو وتخبطه.

⭕ أبو عبيدة: كل العالم يشهد خداع المجرم الفاسد نتنياهو ووزير حربه، فقد كانوا يمنون جمهورهم ويخدعون العالم بأن معركة رفح هي الضربة القاضية وهي المحطة الفاصلة، فلم تكن معركة رفح سوى استكمال من العدو لسياسة التدمير الممنهج والمجازر ضد المدنيين.",865.0,0.0,0,False

1) We proberen onze verdriet en woede op een constructieve manier om te zetten in ongeziene burgerkracht: **het kamp van vrede, liefde, solidariteit en menselijkheid, dat zijn wij! **🕊 
 
2) Ons doel is om mensen van ALLE achtergronden samen te brengen die in een meer humane wereld willen leven. **Laten we daarom leuzen gebruiken in talen die de meerderheid hier in België begrijpt (FR, NL, EN) en zonder religieuze connotatie. **Dit is niet alleen de strijd van één religie, maar de strijd van de hele mensheid. 🤝 
 
3) Het verzet tegen de onrechtvaardigheden die dit volk al 75 jaar ondergaat, mag op geen enkele manier leiden tot passieve of actieve: Essentialisering van de joodse gemeenschap met het Israëlische beleid; Vereenvoudigingen tussen de Israëlische samenleving en de Israëlische regering; Antisemitische boodschappen, daden en toespraken. Dit alles is onaanvaardbaar en zal altijd afbreuk doen aan de vooruitzichten op eenheid met allen die solidair kunnen zijn met deze zaak. **Er zijn veel Joden die de Palestijnse zaak steunen, en we moeten hen beschermen en met liefde omringen. **👏 
 
4) Zondag, **laten we allemaal een actieve rol spelen om ervoor te zorgen dat iedereen gedisciplineerd blijft en dat er geen incidenten zijn. **Elke vorm van misdraging tijdens de manifestatie zal tegen ons en onze zaak worden gebruikt! 💪

1)    Nous transformons notre peine et notre colère de manière constructive en force citoyenne historique : **le camp de la paix, de l’amour, de la solidarité, de l’humanité, c’est nous !** 🕊 
 
2)     Notre objectif est de rassembler LARGE des personnes de tous les horizons qui veulent vivre dans un monde plus humain. Pour cela, **favorisons les slogans dans des langues compréhensibles par la majorité ici en Belgique (FR, NL, EN) et sans connotation religieuse. **Ce n’est pas que le combat d’une religion mais le combat de toute l’humanité. 🤝 
 
3)     S’opposer aux injustices que subit le peuple palestinien depuis 75 ans ne peut en aucun cas donner lieu de façon passive ou active à : une essentialisation de la communauté juive à la politique israélienne ; des raccourcis entre société israélienne et gouvernement israélien ; des messages, actes et discours antisémites. Tout ceci n’est pas acceptable et desservira toujours les perspectives d’union avec tous ceux qui pourraient être solidaires de cette cause.** Il y a de nombreux juifs qui soutiennent la cause palestinienne et nous devons les protéger et les couvrir d’amour.** 👏 
 
4) Dimanche, **jouons tous un rôle actif pour faire en sorte que tout le monde reste discipliné et qu’il n’y ait pas d’incidents. **Tout débordement à la manifestation sera utilisé contre nous et contre notre cause ! 💪

Salut à tous, on lâche pas ! 
Ce mercredi, les USA ont bloqué une résolution du conseil de sécurité de l’ONU 🇺🇳proposée par le Brésil 🇧🇷. Malgré son rejet, on peut dire qu’il y a une évolution positive avec la France 🇫🇷 a voté pour et que le Royaume-Uni 🇬🇧 s’est abstenu, probablement en grande partie grâce aux pressions des opinions publiques. C’est que la pression monte et paie. 

En attendant, vu la gravité des événements, on peut s’attendre à ce que ça ne s’arrête pas d’ici peu. Par conséquent, il faut se préparer à rester mobilisés longtemps et de manière efficace. **Nous vous invitons donc à faire grandir cette chaîne Telegram en Belgique en la partageant en MASSE!** Pour cela, cliquez en haut sur le titre de la chaîne et copiez le lien de la chaîne, puis partagez là avec vos connaissances, en story instagram, etc.

Hallo allemaal, we geven niet op! 
Op woensdag blokkeerden de VS een resolutie van de VN-Veiligheidsraad 🇺🇳 van Brazilië 🇧🇷. Ondanks de afwijzing is er een positieve ontwikkeling geweest: Frankrijk 🇫🇷 stemde voor en het Verenigd Koninkrijk 🇬🇧 onthield zich van stemming, waarschijnlijk grotendeels dankzij de druk van het publiek. De druk neemt toe en werpt vruchten af. 

Gezien de ernst van deze gebeurtenissen is het einde nog niet in zicht. We moeten dus bereid zijn om lang en effectief gemobiliseerd te blijven. **We nodigen je uit om dit Telegram-kanaal te helpen groeien in België te delen!** Om dit te doen, klik op de titel van het kanaal bovenaan de pagina en kopieer de link, deel het dan met je vrienden, in een Instagram story, etc.

Ik neem aan dat jullie het vreselijke nieuws hebben gezien van de bombardementen op het ziekenhuis in Gaza, en op de school (gerund door de VN) die in de buurt als schuilplaats werd gebruikt 😞

Met de aanslag van gisteren in Brussel is het moreel nog lager. Maar we gaan ons verdriet omzetten in strijd ✊

We houden je hier op de hoogte van de acties. De ""Boycot Axa"" actie van vrijdag moest worden afgelast na onderhandelingen met de politie.

De demonstratie van morgen in Leuven gaat wel door, op het Martelarenplein om 17.30 uur, dus vertel het verder!

De demonstratie van zondag blijft een prioriteit. Alle nieuwe informatie zal hier worden doorgegeven.

Wat de aanslag van gisteren betreft: vertel je omgeving dat deze crimineel zei NIETS met Palestina te maken te hebben, en dat Islamitische Staat een groep is die niets te maken heeft met Hamas (en in feite een tegenstander op het terrein is). Laten we deze verwarring niet laten verspreiden.

Blijf de link delen https://t.me/PalestineSolidarityBelgium

Ik heb hier ook wat visuals geplaatst die je kunt gebruiken om het evenement onder de aandacht te brengen of om inhoud te delen.

Ik wens jullie veel sterkte ❤️",306.0,0.0,0,True

Je suppose que comme beaucoup vous avez vu les terribles nouvelles du bombardement de l’hôpital à Gaza, et de l’école (gérée par l’ONU) qui servait de refuge tout proche 😞

Avec l’attaque hier à Bruxelles, le moral est encore plus bas. Mais nous allons transformer notre peine en lutte!✊

On vous tient au courant ici des actions. L’action de vendredi “Boycott Axa” a dû être annulée après négociations avec la police.

Le rassemblement DEMAIN à Leuven est par contre maintenu, à Martelarenplein 17h30, à faire tourner dans vos contacts!

La manifestation de dimanche est A PRIORI maintenue. Toute info nouvelle passera ici.

Quand à l’attaque de hier: répétez autour de vous, ce criminel n’a RIEN revendiqué en rapport avec la Palestine, et l’Etat islamique est un groupe qui n’a rien à voir avec le Hamas (et même adversaires sur le terrain en réalité). Ne laissons pas passer l’amalgame.

Geconfronteerd met de verschrikkelijke beelden van de voortdurende bloedbaden in Gaza, vragen veel mensen zich af hoe ze kunnen helpen, hoe ze zich kunnen organiseren en hoe ze hun solidariteit kunnen tonen.

Op sociale media maken shadowbanning en andere technieken de inhoud van solidariteit met Palestina steeds minder zichtbaar, maar dat zal ons niet tegenhouden!

Dit kanaal zal de komende dagen en weken gebruikt worden om solidariteitsacties en evenementen in heel België uit te zenden.

Voorlopig:

1️⃣ Deel deze link zoveel mogelijk! In stories, in DM's, overal.

2️⃣ Boek alvast zondag 22/10, 14u in Brussel, NATIONALE solidariteitsbetoging met Gaza, tegen de massamoorden door het Israëlische leger.

Ce canal va servir à diffuser les actions et évènements de solidarité à travers la Belgique, pour les jours et semaines à venir.

Pour l’instant :

1️⃣ Faire tourner ce lien un maximum ! Dans les story, en DM, partout.

2️⃣ Bloquez le dimanche 22/10, 14h à Bruxelles, rassemblement NATIONAL en solidarité avec Gaza, contre les massacres perpétrés par l’armée israélienne

Fatwa tersebut juga merekomendasikan agar pemerintah mengambil langkah-langkah tegas membantu perjuangan Palestina.

Ketua MUI Bidang Fatwa, Asrorun Niam Sholeh menegaskan, mendukung agresi Israel baik secara langsung maupun tidak langsung seperti membeli produk dari produsen yang secara nyata mendukung Israel haram hukumnya.

Taking a stance to support the Palestinian population by boycotting products that have ties to Israel is a form of peaceful protest and solidarity. This approach involves conscientiously refraining from purchasing or using goods and services from companies that have significant financial or political connections to Israel. The idea behind this strategy is to exert economic pressure on entities that may indirectly or directly contribute to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While it's important to remember that individual consumer choices alone may not resolve the complex geopolitical issues at play, some individuals and organizations choose to engage in such boycotts as a way to raise awareness, express their political views, and advocate for change.

__— After more than 470 days of aggression, genocide, ethnic cleansing, massacres, slaughters and Zionist arrogance, the resistance and its negotiating delegation were able to achieve the legitimate demands and conditions of our people, and a truce and ceasefire agreement was reached between our Palestinian people, their resistance and their valiant factions and the fascist Zionist entity. This is the result and fruit of steadfastness, perseverance and great sacrifices during which our people offered their best sons, heroes and leaders as martyrs on the road to Jerusalem and Palestine.

— This agreement, in its first stage, would not have been possible without the steadfastness of our people, their roots and their adherence to their land despite the brutality, killing, massacres and war of extermination and ethnic cleansing carried out by the Zionist enemy supported by the unjust American and Western decision, weapons and money.

— The priority of the resistance was clear and fixed, which is to stop the aggression, return the displaced to their homes, provide urgent relief, a serious prisoner exchange deal and reconstruction.

— As our people and their resistance were a model of patience and sacrifice, they will remain proud, lofty, steadfast and firm on their land. Neither wounds nor destroyed homes can weaken their resolve or break their will. Our people and their valiant, steadfast, confident resistance, believing in God's promise and victory, will remain a burning, blazing, rooted, and unwavering flame on the path to liberating Palestine from its sea to its river.

— We salute our steadfast people, their heroic resistance fighters and their proud fighters who stood firm and patient in the field of confrontation and struggle, shattered the myth of the invincible army and trampled on the heads of its soldiers, officers and leaders in the revolutionary camp of Jabalia and Beit Hanoun, the legend, until ""Hanoun Jarad"" and all of northern Gaza, Khan Younis and its eastern part, Rafah, the middle, Gaza City and its neighborhoods became witnesses to the dawn of the new nation and the inability of the usurping entity to achieve its goals despite the great destruction and abundant sacrifices.

— Peace be upon the souls of all the martyrs of our heroic people in Gaza, the West Bank, the occupied interior, and in the diaspora, and peace be upon the martyrs of Hezbollah, Ansar Allah, Jordan, and Iran, and peace be upon the souls of the leaders His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, Saleh al-Arouri, Abdul Aziz al-Minawi, Muhammad Abdul Aal, Raafat, Khaled Abu Hilal, Abbas Nilforoushan, Sayyed Hashem Safi al-Din, Fouad Shukr, Ibrahim Aqil, Ali Karaki, and all the leaders whose names will be engraved with a ray of light in the history books.

— Greetings to all the great fronts and arenas of support, so greetings to the Islamic Resistance in Hezbollah and its great martyrs of leaders and soldiers, and to the heroes of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, and to the great Yemeni people and to the heroes of its armed forces, and to Islamic Iran, its people, army, and leadership, who were a support and backing for our people and our resistance.

__— We also salute the support fronts, foremost among which is the Islamic Resistance Front in  Lebanon, which did a great job in fighting and sacrificing and offered the most precious thing it had in redemption for Gaza, Palestine and Jerusalem, and those sacrifices were crowned by the martyr of Islam and humanity, the great leader Sayyed  Hassan Nasrallah, may God Almighty be pleased with him.__

__— We in Yemen thank God Almighty for enabling our dear people and armed forces to bear this responsibility by supporting Gaza with weekly million-man demonstrations and effective and influential military operations from the beginning of the flood until the ceasefire was declared in Gaza.__

__— Despite the continued siege on our country and the wounds our people are suffering from as a result of the years of previous aggression and the difficult economic conditions, this did not dampen resolve, but rather motivated and encouraged us to assume the responsibility of supporting Gaza, which is a religious and humanitarian responsibility for which the entire nation is responsible.__

__— Yemen's entry into the battle of supporting Gaza was not due to an excess of power or a show of force, but rather from a difficult reality. Then, the ~~Israeli~~ invasion of Gaza left no room for our dear people, who are saturated with the spirit of faith, to participate and support in fulfilling their responsibility towards an oppressed people who are being subjected to genocidal massacres before the eyes and ears of the entire world.__

The ""israeli"" army has identified combat methods by Hamas inspired by the Lebanese front, including ambush traps, planting powerful underground explosive devices, and recording operations against ""israeli"" forces to achieve widespread psychological effects.  

A severe incident occurred at a fortified site of the ""Shaked"" Battalion of the Givati Brigade in Jabalia, where approximately twenty fighters attacked and infiltrated the ""israeli"" site. Three soldiers were killed, and 20 others were injured in the attack.  

The ""israeli"" army has concluded its investigation into the incident, described as extremely serious. The findings revealed that the fighters filmed the attack at close range, mimicking Hezbollah's attack style on ""israeli"" sites in the security zone of southern Lebanon.

In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
God Almighty said: {And God will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, God is Powerful and Exalted in Might} God Almighty's truth.

In victory for the oppression of the Palestinian people and their mujahideen and in response to the massacres against our brothers in Gaza, and within the fifth stage of the support stages in the battle of the promised conquest and the holy jihad and within the framework of responding to the Israeli aggression against our country.

The missile force in the Yemeni Armed Forces, with the help of God Almighty, targeted a military target of the Israeli enemy in the occupied Jaffa area, and with a hypersonic ballistic missile, Palestine 2.

The missile hit its target accurately and the defenses and interception systems failed to intercept it.

With this qualitative operation, the Yemeni Armed Forces salute all the sons of our great Yemeni people who went out to the squares and fields, emphasizing the confrontation and challenge to the criminal Israeli enemy.

It also salutes the Mujahideen in the Gaza Strip and their ongoing heroic operations against the Israeli enemy and confirms that, with the help of God Almighty, it will continue to support them until the aggression stops and the siege on the Gaza Strip is lifted.

Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best Disposer of affairs, the best Master and the best Supporter.

Long live Yemen, free, honorable and independent.
And victory to Yemen and to all the free people of the nation

****The locals who warmly welcomed the Israeli soldiers are not just random people.

The delivery of humanitarian aid and medical treatment was openly and officially acknowledged long ago, several years back. However, arms supplies were a taboo topic, only discussed in whispers. Now, with Assad's regime no longer in power, such matters are spoken about freely. Moreover, it all happened six or more years ago. For the Israel Defense Forces, these people are not strangers, and for the locals, Israeli soldiers are not enemies — their arrival is no surprise.****

The Security Council, the international community, and Arab and Islamic countries bear responsibility for rejecting and ending it and protecting the Syrian people at a sensitive and pivotal stage in their history.

We have always warned against Israeli ambitions in the entire region and resisted them to prevent the occupation from achieving its goals. We have reiterated that the aggression on Gaza is a war of extermination and a starting point for changing the face of the region and ending the Palestinian cause.

The complete silence of Arabs, Muslims, and the international community towards the criminal aggression on Syria, with unlimited American support, and the failure to take practical measures to confront this aggression and support the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights, has led to Zionist persistence and encroachment on the countries of the region.

All steps must be taken to prevent the Israeli entity from achieving its goals, and not to remain silent or watch this brutal aggression against Syria and its people. What is happening in Syria today at the popular and political levels, and the resulting internal and external political choices, is the exclusive right of the Syrian people, independent of any external influences and pressures.

We hope that Syria will settle on the choices of its people, achieve its renaissance, and be in a position of rejecting the Israeli occupation, preventing external interference in its affairs.

We will remain a supporter of Syria and its people in their right to build their future and confront their enemy, the usurping Israeli entity.

In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

The ongoing crimes committed by the Zionist enemy on Syrian territory, whether through occupying more land in the Golan Heights or targeting and destroying Syria’s defensive capabilities, constitute blatant aggression and a brazen violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian state and its people. These actions further destabilize this brotherly country.

This aggressive occupation of Syrian lands coincides with the continued aggression of the Zionist army against Lebanon, its daily violations, and its attacks on Gaza. These actions place the peoples of the region in imminent danger, underscoring the unity of their struggle and the necessity of rejecting and confronting this aggression.

While we condemn these attacks, we warn of the consequences of their continuation. We also call on the world, particularly the Arab and Islamic nations, to take firm stances against these crimes and to exert pressure in all political and legal arenas to put an end to this series of aggressions, as all the justifications presented by the enemy are baseless fabrications.

The enemy’s attempts to seize additional Syrian lands cannot establish any form of legitimate rights, as this can only be described as an ongoing occupation in the Golan Heights since 1967.

We reaffirm our solidarity with Syria and its people and stress the necessity of preserving Syria’s unity in both its land and its people.

In 1998, Hezbollah’s Shura Council expelled him, stripping him of his leadership and membership. This marked the first time someone of his rank had been removed from the organization.

1️⃣ The expulsion stemmed from major disagreements over the direction of the group. Tufaili opposed Hezbollah’s decision to participate in Lebanese politics, insisting that it should focus only on fighting ~~Israel~~. His refusal to adapt to the group’s evolving strategy created growing tensions. Hezbollah’s leadership wanted to expand its role beyond military resistance, but Tufaili’s rigid views stood in the way.

2️⃣ After being expelled, Tufaili returned to his home region in the Bekaa Valley, where he became a vocal critic of Hezbollah and Iran. He accused them of exploiting Lebanon for their own interests and denounced their growing influence in the region. However, his influence has faded over time, and his occasional statements are now seen as irrelevant to the group’s current activities, and to the Lebanese. 

3️⃣ Tufaili was expelled from Hezbollah and has since become a mouthpiece for Zionists and Wahhabis.

haqqintel,4065,2024-12-03T18:24:00+00:00,"**📹A video is currently circulating featuring a Hamas representative in Turkey, Talal Nasser (whom we never heard of), claiming that the resistance supports Mossad agents in Syria and opposes Bashar al-Assad. 

🔎 Here’s why this claim should be critically evaluated:

1️⃣ Historical Context: While Hamas and Syria have had conflicts in the past—most notably during the conflicts  in 2011, when Hamas supported rebel groups—Iran temporarily reduced its funding for Hamas due to this stance. However, relations between Hamas and Syria were later reconciled, with both reaffirming their shared goal of removing the ~~Israeli~~ occupation.

2️⃣ Source of Authority: A representative like Talal Nasser, based in Turkey and largely unknown to many Palestinians, cannot speak authoritatively on Hamas’s stance. The official positions of Hamas come from high-ranking leaders such as Abu Obeida, Osama Hamdan, or  Shaheed Yahya Sinwar. Sinwar, in particular, supported the removal of Mossad agents in Syria and backed Bashar al-Assad. Hamdan, too, holds a similar position.

3️⃣ Official Statements: To understand Hamas’s official position, one must refer to the movement’s communiqués or statements from its top leadership. The most recent public declaration on Syria came in 2024 from Osama Hamdan, a well-respected and prominent figure within Hamas, supporting Syria. 

4️⃣ The Political Wings: Hamas’s political and military wings have historically exhibited differing stances toward the Syrian government. The military wing has generally maintained a pro-Assad position, while the political wing’s support has varied. However, Shaheed Yahya Sinwar was in support of both. 

5️⃣ Disseminating videos featuring representatives like Talal Nasser, who opposes Bashar al-Assad, can create fire between Hamas and Syria. It’s important to recognize that both entities have previously experienced conflicts but have since reconciled. For instance, Ismail Haniyeh, initially critical of Syria, later retracted his statements to support Assad and opposed the “rebels.”

1️⃣ Our armed forces operating on the fronts of the Aleppo and Idlib countrysides continue to confront the major attack launched by the armed terrorist organizations under the so-called ""Terrorist Jabhat al-Nusra"", which uses various types of heavy and medium weapons in addition to drones in its attack, and relies on large groups of foreign terrorist militants. 

2️⃣ Our armed forces were able to inflict heavy losses on the attacking organizations and inflicted hundreds of dead and wounded terrorists in their ranks, and destroyed dozens of armored vehicles and vehicles, and were able to shoot down and destroy seventeen drones. 

3️⃣ Our armed forces continue to reinforce all points on the various axes of engagement with equipment and soldiers to prevent terrorist violations on those axes and repel their attacks.

4️⃣  Operational Highlights and Achievements:

   - Despite “israel’s” ground operations in Lebanon since October 1, 2024, the enemy has failed to occupy or establish a foothold in any first-line villages. It has also been unable to create a military or security buffer zone, disrupt rocket and drone launches, or deter attacks on its interior. Resistance fighters have continued to target the enemy from border villages until the last day of the aggression.  

   - The second phase of the ground invasion was merely a political and media announcement. The enemy failed to advance into second-line villages, suffering heavy losses in locations like Khiyam, Ainatha, Talousa, Bint Jbeil, and Qouzah. Its only attempt to advance into Bayada and Shamaa ended disastrously, with elite forces retreating under heavy blows.

5️⃣  Preparedness of Resistance Defenses:

   - The Resistance’s defense strategy relies on a zone-based system, with over 300 defensive lines south of the Litani River, all fully equipped in terms of personnel, weaponry, and capabilities. The outcomes in Bayada and Khiyam testify to this preparedness.  

6️⃣ Ongoing Vigilance:

   - The Islamic Resistance Operations Room affirms that its fighters across all military specialties remain fully prepared to counter any “israeli” aggression or ambitions. They will vigilantly monitor enemy movements and withdrawals beyond the border, ready to defend Lebanon’s sovereignty and honor, and to uphold the dignity of its people.

بِسْمِ اللَّـهِ الرحمن الرَّحِيمِ
 ﴿أُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَاتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ظُلِمُوا وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ على نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ﴾
 صدق الله العلي العظيم

In support of the steadfast Palestinian people, in solidarity with their brave and honorable resistance, and in defense of our resilient Lebanese people, the Islamic Resistance continues its path, adhering to the command of its late Secretary General and supreme martyr, His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah (رض), and under the leadership of his successor, His Eminence Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem (ح). Over more than 13 months, the Resistance has maintained its pledge and jihad, achieving victory over the delusional enemy who failed to break its resolve or weaken its determination. The battlefield spoke loudest, with its pure and devout fighters relying on Allah to thwart the enemy's plans, defeat its forces, and write epic chapters of steadfastness and sacrifice in the battles of ""Al-Aqsa Flood” and ""Awliya' al-Ba's"".

On this auspicious occasion, the Resistance announces the following:  

1️⃣  Operations Statistics:

   - Since the launch of ""Al-Aqsa Flood"" operations on October 8, 2023, the Islamic Resistance has carried out more than 4,637 declared military operations over 417 days, averaging 11 operations per day.  

   - Among these, 1,666 diverse military operations** have been conducted since the start of the “israeli” aggression on Lebanon and the launch of ""Awliya' al-Ba's"" on September 17, 2024, averaging 23 operations daily. These operations targeted “israeli” army sites, barracks, bases, cities, and settlements from the Lebanese-Palestinian border to beyond Tel Aviv. They also included heroic confrontations with enemy ground incursions into Lebanese territory.

2️⃣  Key Operations within ""Awliya' al-Ba’s”:

   - The Resistance carried out 105 specialized operations as part of the ""Khaybar Series"", targeting dozens of critical military and security bases for the first time in the Zionist entity's history. These operations used advanced ballistic missiles, precision-guided rockets, and sophisticated drones, reaching depths of up to 150 kilometers inside occupied Palestine, beyond Tel Aviv.

3️⃣  Enemy Losses:

   - Since the start of “israel’s” ground invasion of Lebanese territory on October 1, 2024, and up to the date of this statement:

     - Over 130 “israeli” soldiers and officers killed and more than 1,250 wounded.  

     - Destruction of 59 Merkava tanks, 11 military bulldozers, 2 Hummer vehicles, 2 armored personnel carriers, and 2 troop transporters.  

     - Downing of 6 Hermes 450 drones, 2 Hermes 900 drones, and 1 quadcopter drone.  

     - (Note: These figures exclude losses in Israeli bases, barracks, settlements, and occupied cities.)

__— Our dear people in their jihadist path hardly a week goes by without offering martyrs.

— Within the framework of the annual anniversary of the martyr, the focus is on three things: consolidating the concept of jihad and the value of martyrdom for the sake of God, remembering the martyrs and drawing lessons from the biography of the martyrs, and purposeful programs to care for the families of the martyrs.

— The annual anniversary of the martyr comes within the framework of major events and changes and the position of our people in support of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples.

— Our dear people within the framework of the battle of the promised conquest and the holy jihad offer martyrs for the sake of God and move in all paths.

— From the first day of our Quranic path, we have offered martyrs in all the past stages within the framework of the position we are in now towards the ~~Israelis~~ and Americans.

— The martyr leader moved with the Quranic project at an important and sensitive stage in which the enemies of the nation, the followers of the Zionist project and its arms, seek to impose their choice on the nation.

— The Zionist project that the Americans and ~~Israelis~~ are moving in is an aggressive project against our nation that confiscates the freedom and independence of the peoples and confiscates the homelands and rights.

— The Zionist project is a threat to the nation and an aggression against it in its identity, religion, independence, freedom, homelands and wealth.

— Acceptance by those who belong to this nation, officially or popularly, of the Zionist project means surrender and being with your enemy who targets you and your nation.

— The Zionist project wants those who accept it to be merely a tool to serve it in what is dangerous for the nation, and this is stupidity and loss in every sense of the word.

— It was and still is very important to determine the choice because the American wants you to either be in the position he wants you to be in or else he will consider you against his program and project.

— Determining the choice and determining the position is a very important issue because the issue is fateful for this world and the hereafter.

— One of the most dangerous things the nation can be exposed to it when some people tend to determine their options and take their positions separately from the principles, values ​​and the Holy Quran.

— When the issue of determining options and positions is separated from the issue of principles and morals, the view will be wrong under the title of interests.

— Most Arab regimes are involved in the option of accompanying the Americans, and they realize that their countries and regimes are targeted.

— Those who announced that they are with America and allied with it turned with it and opened everything to it, they opened their countries to military bases and American dictates at the political and media levels and in religious discourse.

— The American move was not only to ensure its interests in the region, but it turned to direct control and subjecting the region with its peoples and governments to direct control and in the interest of the ~~Israeli~~ enemy.

— The American moved to take steps beyond the issue of interests, and he wants the ~~Israeli~~ to be his exclusive agent who completely controls the reality of what they call the ""Middle East.”__

The most violent and extensive attack on the region was tonight.

5️⃣ The enemy's goals in striking the land routes are to prevent the arrival of humanitarian aid and also to try to cut off the military supply routes for the resistance. There is an intensive Arab-Western media effort to establish the narrative that Syria can stop support and cut off supplies to the resistance.

6️⃣ Today, the Russian President's special envoy to Syria, Alexander Lavrentiev, in a statement to Sputnik, gave a clear answer to ""Israel"" about its desire to obtain guarantees to prevent the supply of weapons from Syria to Lebanon, that this is outside the scope of the Russian military's mandate. The meaning of the message is that Russia is not concerned with this issue and has nothing to do with it.

7️⃣ Syria informed its ally that the issue of supplying weapons to the resistance has nothing to do with Russia and that it has no mandate in this matter, and the matter is impossible to happen. The series of attacks on scientific research and defense laboratories in Damascus Masyaf, Homs, Hama, and even the last aggression on Aleppo.

8️⃣ The enemy is currently intensifying its aggression on the central region, and we have seen throughout the past months an intensification of its attacks, especially on the Syrian Arab Army's ammunition depots and facilities, especially in Homs, Hama, Masyaf, and the roads in the central region, and the humanitarian and relief aid convoys in Homs and the roads near the Syrian-Lebanese border.

9️⃣ The enemy continues to escalate against Syria, and we must expect a major escalation and intensification of the aggression, especially on scientific research facilities, defense laboratories, ammunition depots, air defense sites, radars, roads, and bridges near the border with Lebanon, and any sites that the enemy believes can form a base and means of support for the resistance.

♦️A few days ago, the “Israeli” enemy carried out an attack on a scientific research facility and defense laboratories of the Syrian Arab Army near Al-Safira in the Aleppo countryside, the attack targeted two points on the site. 

➡️ Why did the enemy carry out this attack? The answer is in the thread below. 

1️⃣ There is a general description today of Syria's role as a bridge for weapons, but in fact this description is not accurate. It is a bridge for weapons coming from Iran. Syria, with its scientific research centers, defense laboratories, and military manufacturing facilities, is a manufacturer of the military capabilities of the resistance. 

2️⃣ Syria manufactures weapons from bullets to missiles and artillery, trains and supplies the resistance with them, and is a huge strategic reservoir for all forms of military, logistical, human, and manufacturing materials support. It is a base on which the resistance in Lebanon relies and a strategic depth that embraces all resistance movements in the region. 

3️⃣ Syria, with Iran, in the last decade has helped the resistance in Lebanon possess the ability to manufacture part of its military capabilities, including drones and the development of some of its missiles. At the same time, the campaign of doubt and distortion of Syria's role by the Arab media. The West continues without stopping while every aggression that occurs on Syria belies everything they say. What is said and promoted in the Arab and Western media and what is written in articles is nothing more than their dreams and wishes. Whoever wants to take their word for it, that is his problem. President Assad’s speech today in Riyadh is not just words, but is based on actions in the past and will continue in the present and in the future, God willing. We see evidence of this with every “Israeli” aggression on Syria.

__— The Popular Front holds the occupation responsible for starving our people.. and warns war merchants, mercenaries and exploiters against their involvement in increasing suffering and acquiescing to the occupation's plans.__

— In light of the unprecedented deterioration of the humanitarian situation and the aggravation of the daily suffering of our people in the Gaza Strip due to the war of extermination waged by the Zionist occupation, in addition to the policies of starvation and systematic siege, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine holds the Zionist occupation fully responsible for this catastrophic situation, and denounces the international partnership in this crime, and the shameful international silence and complicity in the policies of mass starvation and daily war crimes committed against our people, and even the involvement of several international institutions in covering up and concealing the crimes of the occupation.

— The Front also stresses that war merchants and mercenaries have played and continue to play a major role in exacerbating the repercussions of the occupation's policies on our people and increasing their tragedy and suffering. 

— The Front affirms that the role of these formations that practice monopoly and sabotage policies, and use gang methods of bullying, looting and monopolizing goods, constitutes a complement to the terrorist policies of the occupation.

— As the Front continues to demand and work for a unified national leadership for the battle in all its aspects, including the presence of a national administration and policies to support the steadfastness of our people, alleviate their suffering and confront the occupation's policy and the treacherous role of war merchants, today, like all the national forces and free people of our people, it is obligated to escalate its role and struggle to protect our people.

— In light of this catastrophic situation, the Popular Front announces its decision, along with the forces and free people in Gaza, to lift the organizational cover from anyone involved in these destructive practices that only serve the occupation and contribute to starving our steadfast people. 

— The Front stresses that it will confront with all its strength anyone who dares to violate the dignity of citizens or contribute to deepening their crises and suffering.

— The Front also renews its full support for the peaceful popular movements that stem from the will of the street and express the just demands to provide the simplest elements of dignity and a decent life in the face of the policies of the occupation and its agents from the merchants of death, thieves and those who benefit from raising prices, stressing that protecting these movements is a joint national responsibility that falls on the shoulders of all forces keen on the safety of our people.

— The Front calls again for activating the Popular Protection Committees to stand firmly against the encroachment of these gangs that attack the dignity of our people and seek to starve and oppress them, and to tighten popular control over the markets and combat the policy of raising prices and monopolizing goods, and to thwart any attempts to create chaos and undermine the unity of the national ranks.

— At the end of its statement, the Popular Front stresses that it, along with all national forces, will not hesitate to defend the dignity of our people and will not allow any practices that increase their suffering to pass, and will continue to struggle and confront with all firmness anyone who tries to exploit the crisis to achieve personal gains at the expense of the dignity of our people and their steadfastness in the face of the occupation.

2️⃣ It is also known as the “Yadin” base, named after Yigael Yadin, the second chief of staff of the ~~israeli~~ occupation army.

3️⃣ Previously, it was a camp for British occupation forces, and a prison where Palestinian revolutionaries were detained.

4️⃣ A force from the “Givati” brigade occupied the camp after battles with Arab forces during the 1948 war.

5️⃣ At that time, the occupation set up a camp to detain Arabs and Palestinians there before closing the prison in 1949.

6️⃣ The base now includes military training and educational camps, as well as headquarters for senior officers in artillery, communications, and the unit responsible for the ~~israeli~~ army spokesperson.

7️⃣ The “108” unit operates in the base, specializing in the maintenance of electronic and technical systems and equipment for the ~~israeli~~ air force.

8️⃣ In 2003, the martyr Ihab Abu Salim from the village of Rantis west of Ramallah, a member of the Al-Qassam Brigades, killed 9 soldiers from the base when he blew himself up among them at a nearby station.

1️⃣ The occupation army announced that it killed 17,000 fighters from Hamas and with the expectation that the number would reach 19,000, but sources in the occupation army recently said that the number of Hamas dead is about 15,000, so how did about 4,000 Hamas fighters return to life in the past four months?

2️⃣ In February 2024, the occupation army announced the killing of about 10,000, and days later Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the army killed 12,000 Hamas members, so the army was forced within days to change its numbers to match what Netanyahu said publicly.

➡️ How can ""Israel"" and its occupation army assess the future of the war without obtaining accurate, realistic numbers, while lying?

♦️ Fourth axis: The operations area of ​​the enemy's 98th Division, extending from Markaba in the south to the occupied Lebanese village of Ghajar in the east. The enemy forces attempted to infiltrate towards the town of Taybeh from the south and east, but the Islamic Resistance fighters confronted them with machine guns and rockets, resulting in a large number of dead and wounded among the infiltrating force. When an enemy support force attempted to advance to withdraw the casualties, the fighters confronted them, inflicting more losses on them and forcing them to retreat. A Merkava tank attempted to advance towards the eastern outskirts of the town of Taybeh, but the fighters targeted it with a guided missile, destroying it and killing and wounding its crew. The fighters also monitored an enemy force's attempt to infiltrate towards the forest of the town of Adaisseh, so they confronted it with appropriate weapons and forced it to retreat. - Fifth axis: The operations area of ​​the enemy's 210th Division, extending from the village of Ghajar to the occupied Lebanese Shebaa Farms. The enemy forces are trying to advance in the outskirts of the towns of Kfar Shuba and Shebaa and control the security barriers near the border, which will protect the border from any ground advance by the resistance. The Islamic Resistance fighters in this axis are intensively targeting the enemy forces' gathering and positioning points and the enemy's military sites with missile weapons.

بِسْمِ اللَّـهِ الرحمن الرَّحِيمِ

أُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَـٰتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ظُلِمُوا۟ ۚ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ (٣٩)

The Islamic Resistance continues to confront the ""israeli"" aggression on Lebanon, and is inflicting heavy losses on the ""israeli"" enemy army in terms of its equipment and personnel, including officers and soldiers, along the confrontation axes at the front edge, all the way to its locations deep inside occupied Palestine.

1️⃣  Ground confrontations:

In the past few days, the surroundings and some neighborhoods of the villages on the front edge of southern Lebanon at the Lebanese-Palestinian border have witnessed many attempts by the ""israeli"" enemy army to advance towards these villages with the aim of occupying and controlling them, as the Islamic Resistance fighters are confronting these attempts on more than one axis according to the following:

♦️ The first axis: The operations area of ​​the 146th Division in the enemy army, extending from Naqoura in the west to Marouhin in the east. The operations on this axis were limited to attempts to infiltrate towards the southern neighborhoods of the villages of Marouhin, Al-Dhahira, Yarin, and Alma al-Shaab, with the aim of booby-trapping and blowing up houses for fear of their use by the Mujahideen. The Islamic Resistance fighters confronted these attempts and targeted the enemy's gatherings and advance paths in Ras al-Naqoura, Hanita, and the surroundings of the village of Al-Dhahira.

♦️ The second axis: The operations area of ​​the enemy's 36th Division, extending from Ramya in the west to Rmeish in the east (Aita al-Shaab including), and from Rmeish to Aitaroun in the east.

After the heroic confrontations witnessed in the Aita al-Shaab - al-Qawzah - Ramya triangle last week, during which the enemy suffered heavy losses at the hands of the resistance fighters. In the past few days, the enemy tried to advance towards the ""Abu al-Laban"" height east of the town of Aita al-Shaab with the aim of occupying it and tightening control over the town. The Islamic Resistance fighters confronted the enemy forces and targeted its gatherings and advance paths in Khallet Warda and the vicinity of the town of Aita al-Shaab. They also targeted many forces that infiltrated the vicinity of the municipality building, which resulted in the deaths and injuries of its members, while the evacuation operations continued for long hours due to the repeated targeting of the resistance. The division's formations are trying to advance towards the center of the town of Aitaroun from the eastern and western neighborhoods with the aim of occupying it and isolating it from its surroundings. In conjunction with attempts to advance towards the center of the towns of Maroun al-Ras and Yaroun from the southern neighborhoods of the two towns. The Islamic Resistance fighters are targeting the gatherings and paths of these formations with dense and repeated salvos, which inflicts heavy losses on them, hinders their movement and forces them to retreat towards uncovered areas.

♦️ The third axis: The operations area of ​​the 91st Division in the enemy army, extends from Blida in the south to Houla in the north. The enemy forces advanced in this axis through invisible paths towards some of the eastern neighborhoods of the towns of Mays al-Jabal, Muhaibib and Blida, where they booby-trapped some houses and blew them up. The enemy forces are trying to advance towards the eastern neighborhoods of the town of Houla amidst violent confrontations with the Islamic Resistance fighters.
It is worth noting that what the enemy army has done in terms of booby-trapping and blowing up the houses of the town of Muhaibib comes after its inability to tighten its control over the town and stabilize its forces for fear of being targeted by the resistance.

As we extend our deepest condolences and blessings to the brothers in Hezbollah, the Lebanese people, the nation, and all supporters of the resistance in the world on the ascension of this jihadist figure The great ones praise his great sacrifices and long struggle and remember his long history in resisting and fighting the Zionist enemy and in supporting the Palestinian people and their noble resistance.

The rise of the great jihadist figures in the battle to defend Jerusalem and support the steadfast Palestinian people alongside their brothers, the martyrs of Palestine and all the mujahideen in the nation and the axis of resistance consolidates the meanings of unity in the nation and confirms the correctness of the path and the unity of the path and destiny.

While we highly value the great sacrifices made by the mujahideen of Hezbollah and its honorable leadership and praise their authentic and steadfast position in supporting our people despite the extent of the aggression, conspiracy and betrayal, we affirm that the policy of Zionist assassinations will not weaken the resolve of the mujahideen and will not break the will of the resistance in the nation and will not restore the prestige of the Zionist enemy and its deterrence.

The enemy's continuation of its brutal crimes reflects the state of failure and helplessness it suffers in the face of the steadfastness and jihad of our resistance in Palestine and Lebanon, and in the face of the qualitative blows it receives in the field and in the depths of the entity, which will escalate and intensify, God willing.

We also confirm that the blood of the leaders and all the martyrs of our people and nation will create a glorious victory and will hasten the defeat of the usurping Zionist entity from the body of our nation, God willing..

2️⃣ Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association was prepared for the aggression, took all necessary precautions, and will meet its commitments.

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful

Dear Muslim Nations!

Dear courageous youth of the region!

The heroic mujahid, Commander Yahya al-Sinwar, has joined his martyred comrades. He was a shining image of Resistance and struggle. He stood with unwavering determination against the cruel, transgressive enemy, striking them with his acumen and courage. He struck the irreparable blow of October 7 [to the Zionist regime] that will be remembered as a part of the history of this region. And then he ascended to the realm of the martyrs with dignity and pride. For one like him who had dedicated his life to the battle against the usurping, cruel enemy, anything less than martyrdom would have been an unworthy fate.

Indeed, his loss is painful for the Resistance Front. However, this front did not halt its progress in the wake of the martyrdoms of eminent figures such as Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Fathi Shaqaqi, Rantisi, and Ismail Haniyeh. Similarly, it will not falter the least with the martyrdom of Sinwar either, God willing. Hamas is alive and will stay alive.

As always, we will stand by the sincere mujahideen and fighters, with God’s help and guidance.
I offer my condolences on the martyrdom of our brother Yahya al-Sinwar to his family, his comrades, and to all those devoted to jihad on the path of God. I congratulate them and offer my condolences for this loss.

May God’s greetings and peace be upon His righteous servants.

In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful 
“And do not think that those who are killed in the cause of God are dead, but rather they are alive and provided for by their Lord.” 

O sons of our struggling Palestinian people... O masses of our Arab and Islamic nation:
  
The Martyr Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades march to Al-Ula, the great martyr, Yahya al-Sanwar, “Abu Ibrahim,” the leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, who rose unplanned in the most honorable of battles in defense of the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque, our people, and their legitimate rights. It is a matter of pride for our movement to present leaders. Before the soldiers, and for its leaders to advance the convoy of martyrs of our people who gave their lives and blood for the sake of God and on the path to liberating Palestine, and for its leader to be martyred among his Mujahideen brothers as a hero clashing with the invaders who thought that Gaza could be an easy prey for their cowardly army. 

The path of our leader, “Abu Ibrahim,” was an honorable jihadi path, during which he was part of the founding generation of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas and its military and security services. Then he sacrificed the flower of his youth as a prisoner in the occupation prisons for more than twenty years before he emerged with his head held high in the “Loyalty to the Free” deal. When he was released from prison, he refused to continue the path of jihad and did not taste any rest. He supervised the movement’s military work in the three regions and had an important role in the process of unifying the resistance fronts on the road to Jerusalem. Then he headed the movement in Gaza, so that his leadership period constituted a qualitative shift in its advocacy, political and military path. Which culminated in the ""Al-Aqsa Flood"", and in the course of national relations and joint resistance work, before he headed the movement at home and abroad following the martyrdom of the great leader Ismail Haniyeh. 

When the resistance factions, with Hamas at their heart, decided to enter this major and decisive battle in the history of the Palestinian people’s jihad and in the path of our nation, they knew that the price of liberation was very high, paid by all peoples before they were liberated from their occupiers, and they were ready for the ranks of the sacrificed people of their people to advance. The leaders and soldiers came forward, refusing to submit to the enemy or remain silent regarding its injustice and plundering of the legitimate rights of our people. The march of our jihad will not stop until the liberation of Palestine, the expulsion of the last Zionist from it, and the restoration of all our legitimate rights. The best proof of this is that our people have not broken or surrendered a year after the battle of the “Al-Aqsa Flood,” despite The heavy prices he paid, despite the brutal Zionist genocide. 

This criminal enemy is delusional if he thinks that by assassinating great resistance leaders like Sinwar, Haniyeh, Nasrallah, Al-Arouri and others, he can extinguish the flame of resistance or push it to retreat. Rather, it will continue and escalate until the legitimate goals of our people are achieved. Martyrdom is the highest aspiration of our leaders, and their blood will be a beacon that illuminates the path to liberation and a fire. It burns the aggressors, and our leaders have left behind hundreds of thousands of mujahideen from our people and nation who are determined to fight the Zionist occupation until Palestine and the Al-Aqsa Mosque are cleansed of its defilement and swept away from our land, God willing.

It is a jihad of victory or martyrdom.

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful 

“__Permission [to fight] is granted to those who are fought against because they have been wronged, and indeed, Allah is Capable of granting them victory.""__
 
Allah, the Almighty, has spoken the truth.

The Islamic Resistance continues to confront the ""israeli"" aggression against Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses on the ""israeli"" enemy army in terms of personnel and equipment, along the front lines in southern Lebanon, extending to their positions deep within occupied Palestine. Since the beginning of ground operations near the Lebanese-Palestinian border, the ""israeli"" enemy has deployed five military divisions comprising over 70,000 officers and soldiers, along with hundreds of tanks and military vehicles. In contrast, hundreds of fighters from the Islamic Resistance are fully prepared to counter any ""Israeli"" ground incursion into southern Lebanese villages.

1. Ground Engagements:

The beginning of this week witnessed an escalation in the heroic confrontations between the fighters of the Islamic Resistance and the ""israeli"" enemy's officers and soldiers advancing through several routes in the eastern and western sectors towards the villages of Al-Odaisseh, Rab El  Thalathin, Blida, Markaba, Al-Qawzah, Aita al-Shaab, and Ramya, under heavy artillery and air cover targeting the mentioned villages and their surroundings. According to pre-prepared field plans, the fighters of the Islamic Resistance engaged the enemy forces in and around some villages by targeting their advance routes and luring them into ambushes within some border villages. Violent clashes took place with the enemy at close range, especially in the towns of Al-Qawzah and Rab El Thalathin, resulting in 10 enemy fatalities and over 150 injuries, as well as the destruction of 9 ""Merkava"" tanks and 4 military bulldozers.

2. Rocket Force:

The rocket force of the Islamic Resistance continues to escalate day by day, targeting ""israeli"" enemy concentrations in military sites and barracks along the Lebanese-Palestinian border, as well as settlements and cities in the north, reaching their military bases deep within occupied Palestine, using various types of missiles, including precision-guided ones that are being deployed for the first time.

3. Air Force:

The air force of the Islamic Resistance continues to escalate day by day, targeting enemy military bases from the Lebanese-Palestinian border to deep within occupied Palestine, utilizing various types of attack drones, including advanced ones being used for the first time, in addition to reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering missions.

4. Air Defense Unit:

Fighters of the Islamic Resistance in the air defense unit have successfully engaged ""israeli"" military aircraft that violate Lebanese airspace, both reconnaissance and combat. They managed to shoot down two reconnaissance aircraft of the type ""Hermes 450.""

According to observations from the fighters of the Islamic Resistance, the enemy's losses have reached approximately 55 killed and over 500 injured among ""israeli"" officers and soldiers, in addition to the destruction of 20 ""Merkava"" tanks, 4 military bulldozers, an armored vehicle, and a troop carrier, along with the downing of two ""Hermes 450"" drones.

⭕ This tally does not include the losses of the ""Israeli"" enemy in military bases and barracks along the Lebanese-Palestinian border extending into occupied Palestine.

__Based on the directives of the Resistance leadership, the Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance announces a transition to a new and escalatory phase in the confrontation with the ""israeli"" enemy, which will be reflected in the developments and events of the coming days.

⭕ Abu Ubaida: Kami salut kepada semua orang bebas di dunia yang berdemonstrasi dalam jumlah jutaan di ribuan lapangan di seluruh dunia, dan masih, selama lebih dari 15 bulan, mendeklarasikan demonstrasi mereka berdasarkan model kepahlawanan, perlawanan, dan ketabahan, penolakan mereka terhadap perang pemusnahan Zionis yang brutal, dan dukungan mereka terhadap perjuangan Palestina yang adil.

⭕ Abu Ubaida : Wahai umat kami, wahai umat kami, kami adalah salah satu dari Anda dan Anda adalah salah satu dari kami. Luka Anda adalah luka kami, rasa sakit Anda adalah rasa sakit kami, dan harapan Anda adalah harapan kami dihancurkan dengan pertolongan Tuhan Yang Maha Kuasa, dan kita akan bersama-sama menghadapi dampak agresi, sama seperti kita bersama-sama menghadapi genosida.

⭕ Abu Ubaida: Ketidakadilan dan genosida yang dilakukan para penjahat akan membuka pintu neraka bagi mereka dari Tuhan Yang Maha Esa dan dari hamba-hamba-Nya, dan konsekuensinya tentu akan sangat mengerikan bagi mereka yang menimpa kita dan yang kita rasakan serta derita bersama rakyat kita adalah harga dari sebuah kemenangan besar. Penaklukan Mubarak adalah sebuah kenyataan yang tak terelakkan.

⭕ Abu Ubaida : Kami akan mengetahui dan kalian akan mengetahui bahwa setiap tetes darah yang tertumpah di bumi ini lebih berharga daripada memenuhi bumi dengan emas, karena itu adalah harga untuk membebaskan bumi, umat manusia, dan tempat-tempat suci.

⭕ Abu Ubaida: Wahai masyarakat kami di Gaza, inilah saatnya solidaritas, saling ketergantungan, dan kasih sayang. Sama seperti kami menghadirkan model kepahlawanan dan kehebatan di lapangan, kami juga akan menghadirkan model ketabahan, konstruksi, dan meraih kebenaran. , menggagalkan semua rencana dan ambisi pendudukan, dan mengalahkannya dengan kemauan dan persatuan kita, Insya Allah Yang Maha Kuasa.

palestineresistance,1975,2023-12-19T20:12:41+00:00,"⭕️ Pernyataan Pers

Selama tujuh puluh tiga hari, pendudukan fasis Israel telah melakukan perang genosida terhadap rakyat Palestina di Jalur Gaza, menggunakan segala jenis senjata, amunisi, dan bom yang dilarang secara internasional dan tanpa pandang bulu membom sekolah-sekolah dan tenda-tenda yang menampung ratusan ribu pengungsi. masyarakat dan rumah sakit yang dilindungi oleh hukum humaniter internasional.

Semua ini dan lebih banyak lagi yang terjadi di depan mata seluruh dunia, dengan dukungan terang-terangan dari AS, Inggris, dan beberapa negara Eropa, mengingat ketidakmampuan komunitas internasional dan semua lembaga PBB yang tidak berfungsi untuk menghentikan agresi ini karena sikap keras kepala dan arogansi pemerintah Amerika dalam penggunaan hak vetonya secara kurang ajar.

Agresi genosida ini telah mengakibatkan pembunuhan massal terhadap lebih dari 19.000 martir, sekitar 52.000 orang terluka, dan hampir 8.000 orang hilang, 70% di antaranya adalah anak-anak dan perempuan. Pendudukan Israel sejauh ini telah melakukan 1.700 pembantaian terhadap warga sipil dan orang-orang tidak bersenjata yang tidak bersalah. Di Tepi Barat yang diduduki, lebih dari 290 martir Palestina telah dibunuh oleh pasukan pendudukan Israel sejak peluncuran agresi di Gaza pada 7 Oktober, ditambah dengan pembatasan ketat yang diberlakukan terhadap warga Palestina di Yerusalem yang diduduki dan di Al-Aqsa. Masjid.

Dalam konteks ini, kami menegaskan hal-hal berikut:

Trio perang yang kalah (Netanyahu-Gantz-Gallant) belum dan tidak akan mampu mencapai tujuan agresif mereka.

Pemerintah fasis Israel, yang dipimpin oleh penjahat perang Netanyahu, tidak peduli dengan kehidupan warga sipil Palestina, tentara, dan tahanannya. Tidak ada bukti yang lebih jelas mengenai hal ini selain berlanjutnya pembunuhan terhadap tahanan oleh pasukan pendudukan Israel. Mereka secara keliru mengklaim bahwa mereka memulai agresi ini untuk membebaskan tahanan mereka, namun sebenarnya, mereka membunuh mereka agar tidak membayar harga yang pantas, yaitu kesepakatan pertukaran tahanan dengan perlawanan Palestina, yang mana tahanan Palestina di penjara-penjara Israel akan dibebaskan.

Adapun perlawanan Palestina, mereka masih bertahan, memberikan pukulan keras dan menimbulkan kerugian besar baik melalui kendaraan atau pasukan Israel yang menyerang. Pada saat yang sama, kami sedih dengan apa yang kami saksikan mengenai penderitaan rakyat kami akibat perang genosida Israel yang menargetkan tanpa pandang bulu di seluruh wilayah Gaza. Kami di sini menyebutkan bahwa 92 jurnalis Palestina sejauh ini telah dibunuh oleh kebrutalan tersebut, yang bertujuan untuk membungkam dan menakuti mereka dalam menyampaikan apa yang terjadi di Gaza.

Satu-satunya pencapaian pendudukan Israel adalah kejahatan perang, genosida, pembunuhan besar-besaran terhadap anak-anak dan perempuan, penghancuran infrastruktur, dan penghapusan seluruh aspek kehidupan. Namun, rakyat Palestina kami yang teguh menunjukkan gambaran paling indah tentang kesabaran, ketangguhan, patriotisme, keterikatan pada tanah air, dan dukungan tanpa syarat terhadap perlawanan mereka.

Kami terus mengatakan bahwa pemerintah AS sepenuhnya bertanggung jawab atas pembantaian dan pelanggaran yang terjadi di tangan tentara pendudukan Israel di Gaza melalui pengiriman senjata tanpa syarat AS untuk membunuh warga Palestina tanpa pertanggungjawaban apa pun.

Terlepas dari posisi Amerika Serikat, Gerakan Hamas memperhatikan seruan yang semakin meningkat dari beberapa pemerintah negara-negara barat untuk mengakhiri agresi terhadap Gaza, selain seruan lain di seluruh dunia yang menuntut gencatan senjata segera di Gaza; yang terakhir adalah pernyataan Kanada, Australia dan Selandia Baru yang mendukung gencatan senjata berkelanjutan di Gaza.

Mereka harus saling bergantian memakai sepatu tiap ke sekolah dikarenakan sepatu Zahra hilang oleh Ali ketika ia sedang menghutang sayuran di pasar.

Sepatu Zahra sebenarnya sudah sangat butut dan jebol. Tapi karena orangtua mereka belum punya uang, akhirnya mereka memutuskan untuk mensol sepatu Zahra agar dapat digunakan lagi.

Saat itu Ali disuruh mengambil sepatu tersebut di tukang sol. Tapi Ali malah kehilangan sepatu Zahra yang ia letakkan di luar, tepatnya di dekat ranjang sayuran. Padahal seorang pemulung telah mengambilnya karena berpikir sepatu itu sudah tidak dipakai (mungkin saking bututnya).

Ali pun mencarinya kemana-mana tapi tidak ketemu jua. Sampai akhirnya dia terpaksa bilang pada Zahra bahwa sepatunya hilang. Zahra pun sedih karena itu adalah sepatu dia satu-satunya untuk ke sekolah besok.

Ali tak tega melihat adiknya menangis dan ia merasa bersalah sekali. Akhirnya ia pun memutuskan untuk meminjamkan sepatunya untuk dipakai Zahra ke sekolah. Padahal Ali juga hanya punya satu sepasang sepatu, itupun sudah agak butut.

Mereka pun akhirnya harus saling bergantian memakai sepatu tersebut. Zahra yang masuk sekolah di pagi hari harus berlari cepat saat pulang sekolah agar Ali dapat segera memakai sepatu saat Ali hendak berangkat sekolah di siang harinya, selisih waktu sekolah antara mereka tidak terlalu banyak sehingga mereka harus saling berlari agar tepat waktu.

Karena hal itu, Ali jadi sering terlambat datang ke sekolah sehingga ia kerap dimarahi oleh salah satu gurunya. Padahal segitu ia sudah berlari sangat cepat.

Sampai akhirnya Ali mengikuti perlombaan lari jarak jauh di sekolahnya dan berharap mendapat juara ketiga. Kenapa ketiga?

Karena hadiah juara ketiga itu adalah sepasang sepatu olahraga. Tapi sayang, Ali malah jadi juara pertama pada perlombaan itu. Bukannya senang, tapi Ali justru sedih karena tidak mampu menepati janjinya kepada Zahra untuk jadi juara ketiga.

Walau ceritanya sangat sederhana, namun film ini sangat sarat akan pesan moralnya. Kehidupan anak- anak miskin di Iran begitu tergambar jelas dalam film karya Majid Majidi ini.

Selain itu, film yang juga tayang di AS dan beberapa negara Asia Timur lainnya ini juga selalu berhasil membuat siapapun yang menontonnya menitikkan air mata.

You were like parents to her, letting her go into your rooms whenever she wanted. She’s admitted that she feels like all of you are her friends, and not just friends, but truly beloved and good people. 

Thank you, thank you, thank you for the many hours you spent as caregivers. Thank you for being patient with her and showering her with sweets, fruits, and everything available even when you didn’t have it. 

Children should not be held in captivity, but thanks to you and other kind people we met along the way, my daughter felt like a queen in Gaza... In general, she says she felt as though she was the center of the world. She hasn't met anyone on our long journey, from the rank and file to the leadership, who didn't treat her with gentleness, affection, and love. 

I will forever be a prisoner of gratitude because she did not leave here with a lifelong psychological trauma. I will remember your kind behavior, granted here despite the difficult situation you were dealing with yourselves and the severe losses you suffered here in Gaza. I wish in this world we could truly be good friends.

 Israel adalah satu-satunya negara yang menerima bantuan ekonomi dan militer langsung tahunan terbesar dari Amerika Serikat sejak tahun 1976.

  -Pada Oktober 2023, Amerika Serikat telah memberikan total $158 miliar kepada Israel dalam bentuk bantuan dan pendanaan militer.

  Amerika Serikat memberi Israel rata-rata $3 miliar per tahun.
 .
 “Orang Amerika keturunan Yahudi telah membentuk serangkaian asosiasi yang bertujuan untuk menentukan arah kebijakan luar negeri Amerika Serikat
 .
  Asosiasi yang paling terkenal dan berkuasa adalah Komite

  Urusan Publik Israel Amerika (AIPAC).

  AIPAC didirikan pada tahun 1951 dan berkantor pusat di

  Washington, nama depan AIPAC adalah Dewan Zionis Amerika.

  Tujuan organisasi yang berganti nama menjadi AIPAC pada tahun 1959,
  Hal ini secara singkat dinyatakan sebagai “mendukung kebijakan yang memperkuat dan memperluas hubungan antara Amerika Serikat dan Israel dengan cara yang akan meningkatkan keamanan Amerika Serikat dan Israel.”

  AIPAC menyalurkan sumbangan kepada para politisi dengan memantau secara ketat siapa yang memberikan suara dan bagaimana DPR dan Senat memberikan suara pada isu-isu relevan

  di Israel dan mengumumkan ini di situs resminya.

  Douglas Bloomfield, mantan anggota Komite Urusan Publik Israel (AIPAC), mengatakan:

  “AIPAC dipanggil untuk membuat undang-undang, memberikan nasihat, dan mempunyai wewenang untuk memberikan suara.”

  Ernest Hollings, mantan Senator Demokrat, berkata:
  “Kami tidak bisa mempunyai kebijakan terhadap Israel di sini selain dari apa yang Komite Urusan Publik Israel bayangkan untuk kami.”

 _Pada tahun 1906, Komite Yahudi Amerika (AJC) didirikan oleh “Yahudi Jerman” yang berimigrasi ke Amerika pada tahun 1830-an.
  Tujuan dari Komite Yahudi Amerika adalah;  Meningkatkan kesadaran mengenai Israel di kalangan masyarakat Amerika, dan mendukung perlindungan identitas orang Yahudi yang tinggal di Amerika Serikat,

 Dan membela hak-hak orang Yahudi dari segala jenis pelanggaran hak asasi manusia.

  Ketika para pembela Israel berada di bawah tekanan yang kuat,
  Mereka mengklaim bahwa kritik terhadap Israel merupakan “gelombang baru anti-Semitisme.”

  Dengan kata lain, menurut pelobi Yahudi, siapa pun yang mengkritik Israel adalah seorang anti-Semit.

  Amerika Serikat, yang tanpa syarat mendukung Israel selama bertahun-tahun di bawah pengaruh kelompok lobi Yahudi, memungkinkan ekspansi Israel ke wilayah-wilayah pendudukan.

  Amerika Serikat terlibat dalam pendudukan Israel dan pembantaian yang dilakukan terhadap warga Palestina.

 Kekuatan Yahudi di Amerika Serikat

  “Jika saya seorang Yahudi, saya akan menjadi seorang Zionis,” kata-kata tersebut diucapkan oleh Presiden AS saat ini, Joe Biden.

 Pada tahun 1986, Biden mengatakan hal berikut: “Jika tidak ada negara bernama Israel, Amerika Serikat akan membentuk satu negara untuk mencapai kepentingannya di kawasan.”

  Pernyataan-pernyataan ini saja sudah menunjukkan betapa eratnya hubungan antara Yahudi dan Amerika Serikat.

  _Yahudi merupakan 3% dari populasi Amerika Serikat, dengan populasi 7 juta orang.

  Namun lingkup pengaruh mereka jauh lebih tinggi dari itu.

  Orang-orang Yahudi, terutama kekuatan ekonomi mereka, secara langsung memandu kebijakan AS.

  Dukungan finansial besar yang diberikan kepada para kandidat dalam pemilu dan promosi kekuatan media mereka disediakan oleh orang-orang Yahudi.

  Dalam salah satu laporan Washington Post, dia mengatakan bahwa “kandidat presiden dari Partai Demokrat bergantung pada orang-orang Yahudi, yang memberi mereka 60% uang.”

The 2022 video, to be precise on May 29 2022, this video contains insults and incitement that hurt the feelings of the world's Muslim community and the Arab nation, by Israelis.  When they were holding a flag parade or something like that, to be precise, I forgot a little, they were entering the holy place of the Islamic community, namely the Al Aqsh Mosque, Baitul Maqdis.

 When thousands of Israeli settlers were seen shouting insults and inciting violence against Palestinians at the Damascus Gate at the entrance to the Muslim Quarter of the Old City, Jerusalem.  Some 25,000 Israeli settlers descended on Palestinian areas of the Old City and Jerusalem in an effort to enforce Jewish sovereignty, provoking Palestinians and attacking residents and property.  Violence and provocations continued throughout the night, resulting in many people being injured and arrested.

 Dalam Islam diyakini bahwa nasib Anda telah dituliskan untuk Anda sebelum dunia ada.  Kapan, di mana, dan bagaimana Anda akan dilahirkan, Anda akan menjadi anak siapa, dan jalan hidup Anda di dunia ini mulai dari dalam kandungan hingga hembusan napas terakhir.

 Kata rahim dalam bahasa arab adalah رحم (𝐫𝐚𝐡𝐦), yang disebutkan dalam Al-Qur'an.  Kata khusus ini begitu indah karena akar kata berasal dari kata رحمه (𝐫𝐚𝐡𝐦𝐚) yang artinya rahmat.

 Sebelum kamu lahir, kamu tumbuh dalam kehangatan, pelukan dan belas kasihan ibumu.  Rasa sakit dan kesabaran yang ibumu lalui untuk mengandung dan membesarkanmu, memberinya imbalan berupa Jannah di bawah kakinya.  Itulah sebabnya, dalam Islam, jika ada orang di dunia ini yang paling layak menerima kebaikanmu, maka orang itu adalah ibumu.

 Allah (swt) mempunyai banyak sifat, dua di antaranya adalah

 الرحمن- 𝐀𝐫 𝐑𝐚𝐡𝐦𝐚𝐧 (𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐌𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐌𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐢𝐟𝐮𝐥)

 الرحيم 𝐀𝐫 𝐑𝐚𝐡𝐞𝐞𝐦 (𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐛𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐌𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐲, ()

 Allah SWT telah memuliakan dan menganugerahkan derajat ini kepada para ibu.  Dia bahkan memilih untuk berbagi dua atributnya dengan kata rahim.  Mengetahui sepenuhnya bahwa hal terdekat yang akan Anda alami untuk merasakan belas kasihan, dalam bentuknya yang paling murni, di dunia ini, adalah melalui ibu Anda.

 Maka anak Gaza tersayang, meski kehangatan tubuhmu telah lepas dari pelukan ibumu, dan kami masih berduka atasmu, kami tahu bahwa kamu telah diambil dari rahmat dunia ini, namun temukanlah kenyamanan mengetahui bahwa kamu telah dipertemukan kembali.  dengan Yang Maha Penyayang.

Dan atas kesabaran ibumu, kami berdoa agar surga di bawah kaki mereka untuk selamanya.

Dia terluka, dia tidak bisa berkata, dia tidak tahu di mana bapak ibunya

Setiap 10 menit 1 anak wafat di Gaza
Ribuan orang tua kehilangan anak

Tak terbilang betapa ribu anak kehilangan orang tuanya

Setiap tangan tertulis nama, mereka tidak ingin mati tanpa penanda

Rumah mereka hanya langit
Kasur mereka hanya Bumi

Kapan kekejaman ini akan berhenti?
Kapan keadilan ini akan menghampiri?

Aku dan Indonesia ku pantang mundur akan terus membantu

Aku dan Indonesia ku akan terus bersamamu 
sampai penjajah itu enyah dari rumahmu

Palestina, kau adalah saudara ku dan aku Indonesia ku akan selalu bersamamu

Indonesian Minister of Foreign Affairs

Laporan itu menjelaskan bagaimana cara kelompok tersebut bisa melakukan rencananya dan tidak terdeteksi pihak AS maupun Israel.

Para anggota Hamas disebutkan berkomunikasi dengan cara yang sama sekali kuno dan menghindari teknologi modern saat ini. Yakni melalui jaringan telepon kabel dibangun dalam sebuah terowongan di bawah Gaza.


Komunikasi dilakukan selama dua tahun itu. Selama waktu tersebut, mereka melakukan komunikasi dan merencanakan operasi serta memanggil ratusan anggotanya. Namun tak ada sama sekali pergerakan selama periode tersebut hingga serangan dilancarkan pada 7 Oktober 2023 lalu.


Dalam laporan tersebut disebutkan pula Hamas juga berhasil lolos dari deteksi AS dan Israel dengan menghindari penggunaan komputer maupun ponsel. Para anggota hanya melakukan komunikasi pada area yang sudah ditentukan saja.

“Tidak banyak diskusi dan bolak-balik serta koordinasi di luar area terdekat,” kata salah satu sumber, dikutip dari CNN (30/10/2023).

Kantor Direktur Intelijen Nasional AS menolak berkomentar dan kedutaan Israel di Washington tidak menanggapi permintaan komentar.

Pihak intelijen AS dan Israel sebenarnya telah mendapatkan peringatan strategis. Namun kedua pihak tidak bisa mengantisipasi serangan 7 Oktober tersebut.


Sebagai informasi, terowongan tersebut dibangun Gaza selama lima belas tahun terakhir. Pihak pasukan pertahanan Israel menyebutnya sebagai ‘metro Gaza’.

Jaringan terowongan membentuk sebuah labirin luas. Di dalamnya menjadi tempat menyimpan seperti roket dan amunisi serta cara para militan untuk bergerak tanpa diketahui lawan.

Menurut pasukan Israel, metro Gaza juga menjadi tempat pusat komando dan juga kendali penting yang dilakukan oleh Hamas.

PALESTINA TIDAK AKAN MATI

Saya terpaksa meninggalkan rumah saya di al-Rimal, sebuah lingkungan di Kota Gaza.

 Dalam beberapa hari terakhir, saya berada cukup dekat dengan serangan udara dan pemboman artileri Israel sehingga saya merasakan teror yang mendalam.  Ini diikuti dengan kesedihan dan duka atas nyawa yang hilang.

 Melihat warga Palestina hidup dalam kondisi yang sangat memprihatinkan, dan melihat rumah kami hancur menjadi puing-puing, telah meninggalkan kesan permanen dalam jiwa saya.

 Yang tidak akan pernah terhapus dari ingatan saya adalah perasaan tidak aman dan tidak berdaya karena tidak mampu membantu mereka yang menderita.

 Namun, bahkan pada saat yang suram ini, ketika Israel mengerahkan kekuatan apartheidnya untuk melawan kita dengan bantuan Amerika Serikat, kita masih berkewajiban untuk mengupayakan perdamaian, keadilan, dan kebebasan.

 Selama lebih dari 16 tahun, Israel telah memblokade Jalur Gaza, yang mengakibatkan kekurangan makanan, obat-obatan, dan air bersih.  Meskipun hukuman kolektif terhadap warga Palestina di Gaza terus berlangsung, Yoav Gallant, menteri pertahanan Israel, menyatakan di tengah serangan Israel terbaru bahwa “kami memberlakukan pengepungan total terhadap [Gaza]. Tidak ada listrik, tidak ada makanan, tidak ada air, tidak ada bahan bakar – semuanya ditutup.”

 “Kami memerangi manusia dan hewan, dan kami bertindak sesuai dengan hal tersebut,” katanya.

 Bahasa ini menyedihkan, menjijikkan, dan melambangkan rasisme pendudukan Israel.
 
Hal ini juga memberikan kenyataan pahit kepada kita: Semua keluarga menderita, dan akan terus menderita, di bawah pengepungan ini.

 Kami melihatnya dengan jelas dalam serangan Israel terhadap sistem layanan kesehatan Gaza. 

 Israel telah menargetkan ambulans dan fasilitas medis, sehingga membahayakan perawatan orang yang sakit dan terluka.

 Hak dasar atas layanan kesehatan telah dilanggar oleh Israel tanpa mendapat hukuman.

 Siapa yang akan melaporkan hal ini?

 Israel tidak mengizinkan jurnalis asing masuk ke Gaza untuk meliput perang tersebut, karena mereka tahu bahwa mereka melakukan hal yang mengerikan di sini.

Iran is the biggest financier of Palestine, which is struggling to get its state back from the occupation of Israeli forces.
 
Iran won the first round.  With 3,000 Hamas fighters, managed to plunge Israel into unprecedented chaos.

 The whole country is in bunkers, everything is stopped, nothing works anymore.  It revealed Israel's weakness, mobilization potential, about 650,000 is the maximum they can mobilize.

 It revealed their military-technological potential, the reaction of the United States and showed the true face of Israel to the world, after they, out of rage and thoughtlessness, began to kill civilians and children in Gaza.

 Anyone who thinks Iran didn't know Israel might invade Gaza is wrong.  

Israel has already entered Gaza several times, the last time in 2014. So it is very likely that this is one of Iran's goals, to provoke Israel to invade Gaza.
 
With the entry in Gaza, the second round begins.  

Hezbollah will begin to constantly harass Israel, or it may become fully involved in the war and destabilize Israel gradually over many years.

 The question is how Hamas and Gaza will respond to the invasion, but judging by the readiness this time, Hamas likely has a huge stockpile of weapons that can do massive irreversible damage to the Israeli army and pave the way for the third round, which is a ground invasion of Israel from  side of Islamic paramilitary organizations throughout the Near East.

 Tampaknya sebagian besar berada di tangan perlawanan inovatif Palestina, yang pada Sabtu pagi melancarkan serangan mendadak terhadap Israel melalui udara, darat dan laut.  Seperti yang diperlihatkan dalam video yang menakjubkan, paralayang ini telah menjadi angkatan udara perlawanan Palestina.

 Operasi Badai Al-Aqsa, serangan besar-besaran yang dipimpin Hamas pada 7 Oktober, tidak diharapkan oleh siapa pun.

 Hal ini terjadi sebagai pembalasan atas pogrom Israel yang sedang berlangsung di kota Huwwara dan Yerusalem di Tepi Barat, terutama oleh pemukim yang menyerbu masjid al-Aqsa selama Hari Raya Agung Yahudi selama sebulan terakhir, belum lagi pengepungan yang sedang berlangsung terhadap Gaza selama lebih dari 10 tahun.  satu setengah dekade.

 Konsensus dari banyak komentator media Arab adalah bahwa perlawanan tersebut telah secara efektif menghapuskan mitos kekuatan militer Israel dan reputasi buruk aparat intelijennya, yang kegagalannya – dilihat dari keberhasilan serangan Palestina yang mengejutkan – sangatlah mengejutkan.

 Yang tidak kalah mengejutkan adalah pengambilalihan beberapa koloni pemukim Israel di dekat perbatasan Gaza dan bahkan sejauh 22 km oleh perlawanan Palestina, seperti dalam kasus Ofakim.

 Mungkin pencapaian besar perlawanan dalam pengambilalihan sementara koloni-koloni pemukim ini adalah pukulan mematikan terhadap kepercayaan yang dimiliki penjajah Israel terhadap militer mereka dan kemampuannya untuk melindungi mereka.

 Laporan segera muncul bahwa ribuan warga Israel melarikan diri melalui gurun dengan berjalan kaki untuk menghindari serangan roket dan tembakan, dan banyak yang masih bersembunyi di dalam pemukiman lebih dari 24 jam setelah serangan perlawanan.

 Mereka yang belum melarikan diri dievakuasi oleh tentara dari lebih dari dua lusin koloni di dekat Gaza.",1551.0,1.0,0,False

This morning, as the sun rises in Gaza, as the people of the north return home without anyone searching or interrogating them, in preparation for a greater march home to all of occupied Palestine and their original homes and lands, as Jabalia camp is filled with its people and families, from the heroic resistance fighters that made the camp a death trap for the genocidal enemy until its last moment, as the doctors, nurses and health workers reopen the hospitals, as the Palestinian police, interior ministry and civil defense — so heavily targeted by the occupier — fan out throughout Gaza, Palestinian prisoners inside the occupation jails are awaiting their liberation in the exchange agreement, Toufan al-Ahrar, the Flood of the Free — liberated by the Palestinian resistance and the great sacrifices of Gaza, accompanied by those throughout Palestine, of Lebanon, Yemen, Iran and Iraq.

The occupation has released a list of names of the prisoners to be liberated within the first stage of the agreement, a process that will take place over 42 days.

The names on the list published by the occupation are exciting and inspiring, including so many of the great leaders of the Palestinian liberation struggle; three of the heroes of the Freedom Tunnel; Nael Barghouthi, the longest-held Palestinian prisoner; Mohammed Abu Warda, with 45 life sentences; Khalida Jarrar, the leading Palestinian academic and leftist; Ammar al-Zaben, the first Palestinian prisoner to conceive a child through ""smuggled sperm;"" Dirar al-Sisi, the Palestinian engineer kidnapped from Ukraine in 2011; Hadeel Shatara, the Palestinian educator and activist;  Iyad Jaradat, who endured years in solitary confinement; Wael Jaghoub, the Palestinian leader and writer behind bars; Bushra al-Taweel, the tireless chronicler of the Palestinian prisoners' cause; the ill strugglers like Moatassem Raddad and Mansour Muqtada; Abla Sa'adat, the wife of Ahmad Sa'adat — and so many more. 

However, we also know that the exchange will be completed in stages and throughout the 42 days, and that the Resistance — the great Resistance that achieved their liberation — is the only trustworthy source of information, and will be coordinating the release of the lists of names of prisoners to be exchanged each day of the releases. 

We will provide immediate translations and information as soon as they are available on an ongoing basis. 

1,737 male and female prisoners will be released from Israeli occupation prisons by the Resistance as part of the FIRST PHASE ONLY of the Flood of the Free. 

We urge everyone, around the world, to join with the Palestinian people in Gaza and everywhere, to celebrate the achievements of the Resistance and the humiliation of the occupier, and to celebrate and welcome each liberated prisoner as the heroes of our global movement that they are, in public events, with posters and public education, with actions and events exposing Zionism and imperialism everywhere.

It's Sunday, January 19th 2025. The clock strikes 8:30 AM. The sun of October 8th is shining now and time just started moving again. 

Good morning, Gaza. 

Peace be upon your people. Peace be upon your wounds. Peace be upon the empty stomachs. Peace be upon the bones scattered in the streets, waiting to be buried. 

A salute of gratitude to your heroes:
To the doctors, the nurses, the medical personnel who never abandoned their duties, working day and night in the most inhumane conditions to stitch, mend, and heal. Those who saw hospitals turned into battlefields —fought, burned, and bombed— becoming the most dangerous places in Gaza, yet refused to leave. 

Salutations to the journalists who raised their voices above the thunder of bombings, until the genocide claimed 205 of their own. They remained in the field, unphased, undeterred, committed to spreading the truth.

To the civil defense teams who pulled survivors from beneath the rubble for 15 long months with their bare hands. Whose ambulances were targeted, shot, and bombed, but never stopped. 

To the mothers of Gaza: we kiss the hands that cooked, held their loved ones, wiped away tears and blood, and rose in the cold of the night to murmur prayers—or scream them—until this day.

To our fathers, brothers, and sons who fought and wrote with their blood the most historic epics of our time. Who held the tents from flying in the cold winter, and put out fires when hospital courtyards were bombed. 

Fifteen months have passed. 

Good morning, Gaza. Good morning, soul of our soul.
I promise to dedicate the rest of my life to serve until your freedom.

Peace be upon the resistance that fought until victory. Peace be upon our blood spilled from South Lebanon to Jenin, from Iraq, Iran, and Yemen to you, Gaza—to your shores. 

The war may end today, but the fight is far from over. We will return. We will rebuild. We will heal. 

We will continue to tell the world the story of this small region that woke us on a Saturday morning to demand freedom for prisoners in colonial jails. The [Flood](https://t.me/PalestineResist/13228) which swept away all the world’s forces of evil who gathered to stifle a cry of freedom.

Yes, we will neither forget nor forgive, and there is no one **[**among us**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/59311)** who will ever compromise on the rights born of all this pain and sacrifice.**

Since the beginning of the aggression, the occupation sought to achieve numerous objectives, some declared and others concealed. They openly stated their aim to eradicate the resistance, eliminate Hamas, retrieve captives through military force, and reshape the region. Their hidden agenda, however, was to liquidate the Palestinian cause, destroy Gaza, [punish](https://t.me/PalestineResist/15519) and displace its people, [crush our people’s aspiration for freedom, obliterate every shred of hope, and erase the legacy of the historic crossing of October 7.](https://t.me/PalestineResist/16964)

**But the criminal occupation collided with the steadfastness of our people and their adherence to their land, failing to achieve any of its declared or hidden goals. Our people stood firm on their land, neither departing nor migrating, becoming the impenetrable shield for their resistance. **

Our brave fighters from the Al-Qassam Brigades, those heroes who astonished the entire world with their extraordinary bravery and operations, stood steadfast until the very last moment of this war. They resisted with honor and ethics, both in defense and attack. They carried out unique operations with unparalleled courage and valor, planting explosives, launching missiles, setting ambushes, and engaging in close combat. They inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, turning the occupation’s machinery into charred coffins.

**We salute all the fighters **[**from the heroic resistance factions,**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/18948)** especially the members of Saraya Al-Quds, our brothers in arms from Islamic Jihad. They exemplified the spirit of the free and sacrificial fighter, giving their lives willingly for the sake of Allah, their homeland, and the defense of their people.**

**Today, we affirm that the occupation has not and will not defeat our people or their resistance, by the grace of Allah. **[**The occupation has achieved nothing**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/23349)** but destruction, devastation, and massacres against our people. It only secured its captives through an agreement with the resistance to stop the war and aggression, along with an honorable prisoner exchange deal.**

We say with confidence and certainty: The [steadfastness of our people,](https://t.me/PalestineResist/24507) their immense sacrifices, and the bravery of their resistance have thwarted and failed the occupation’s declared and hidden goals for this war. Our people’s will remains free, unyielding, and pure, untouched by betrayal or weakness. Instead, they have remained proud and resilient to the last moment, by Allah’s grace.

To our loyal and giving people… as we announce the achievement of a ceasefire and the end of the aggression, we extend all words of gratitude and appreciation to everyone who stood by us, our people, and our resistance during the harsh moments.

**We particularly mention here **[**our brothers on the support fronts in Lebanon,**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/50659)** especially **[**the brothers in Hezbollah,**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/61568)** who have offered hundreds of martyrs from among their leaders and fighters on the path to Al-Quds, led by **[**His Eminence Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/61240)** and his leadership team.**

We also remember the support of our brothers in the Islamic Group and the great resistance, sacrifices, and immense patience shown by the Lebanese people in defense and solidarity with our Palestinian people.

Most of the recent events prove that the Resistance is the only sovereign party that truly acts for the benefit of the country alone, not external parties. The Resistance has proven to have the needed insight to balance between regional events and national benefit. While supporting Gaza, it also defended Lebanon, and now, internally, the Resistance expressed its willingness to cooperate for the benefit of the country in word and action.

The election of the current president is certainly no win for the Resistance for several reasons: Hezbollah had expressed their refusal to vote for Joseph Aoun, who is close to the US, and insisted on their candidate, Frangieh, who is a close ally of the Resistance. Due to extensive pressure from external parties (headed by the US), it was clear that Frangieh had no luck at all. If Hezbollah wanted a president in the country, they had to compromise. However, Hezbollah and the Amal Movement (together nicknamed the Shia Duo in Lebanon) set their conditions to vote for Aoun to earn certain benefits in the coming governmental cabinet, in addition to guarantees related to rebuilding the areas affected by the war and establishing a defense strategy for the country. Hezbollah was not able to decisively choose a candidate for the presidency, but the Shia Duo was able to come out without complete loss from the situation.

Aoun has been very close to the Americans, especially throughout the past years.
Under his leadership of the Lebanese Army, the army fought alongside Hezbollah in the Aarsal battle and liberated Lebanese land from the takfiri terrorist groups in 2017. The decision was taken by then-president Michel Aoun, and the battle had started before Joseph Aoun became Head of the Army.
The liberation of Aarsal and its surroundings was labeled as the second liberation after the first liberation of South Lebanon in 2000.

The election of a president of America's choice in Lebanon today is further proof that sovereignty here is a facade. This is why America seeks to ""defend democracy"" in other nations. This also stands as proof that democracy itself is a fraud, especially as the people of most nations have proven to be ignorant of their enemy and of where the benefit of their countries lies.
Most of those who speak in the name of sovereignty in Lebanon are fools who insist on disarming the Resistance for the army to defend and liberate our lands, which it is incapable of doing. Today, these same parties also voted for the candidate the US, an external party, chose.

What the future holds and what Joseph Aoun will do as the president of Lebanon, a position with very limited authority (which makes it almost symbolic), but still some authority, remains unknown. We cannot, however, build a nation when our definitions of sovereignty are very different, and when we do not have a common enemy. This is one of the many reasons why the Resistance remains a necessity, regardless of democracy and popular opinion.",135.0,0.0,0,False

This crime is part of a series of blatant violations practiced by the occupation against our brave prisoners, as hundreds of them suffer from harsh detention conditions that lack the most basic elements of human life, including necessary medical care, which constitutes a blatant violation of all international laws and conventions.

These inhumane practices are nothing but an attempt to undermine the determination and will of our prisoners, who are steadfast in the face of the occupation and its oppressive practices. We call on human rights institutions and international organizations to assume their responsibilities towards these ongoing crimes, and to work seriously to pressure the occupation to end the suffering of the prisoners and guarantee their basic rights.

We ask Allah to bestow His vast mercy upon the martyr Ismail Youssef Taqatqa and all the martyrs, and to make their pure blood a curse on the oppressors, and we ask Him Almighty to grant imminent freedom to all our prisoners who are still resisting the machine of oppression in the enemy's prisons with their bodies and souls**.

The Prisoners' Authority, The Prisoners' Club, and all relevant institutions held the occupation fully responsible for their martyrdom. They renewed their demands for the international human rights system to move forward in taking effective decisions to hold the occupation leaders accountable for the war crimes they continue to commit against our people, to impose sanctions on the occupation that would place it in a state of clear international isolation, restore the human rights system to its basic role for which it was created, and put an end to the terrifying state of helplessness that it has been subjected to in light of the war of extermination, as well as to end the state of exceptional immunity that the old colonial powers granted to the occupying ""state"" of ""israel"" as it is above accountability, judgment and punishment.

🔴 The Prisoners' Authority and the Prisoners' Club: The occupation is carrying out systematic liquidation and killing operations against prisoners and detainees in its prisons and camps.

12-30-2024

Ramallah - The Prisoners' and Freed Prisoners' Affairs Authority and the Palestinian Prisoners' Club announced the martyrdom of four detainees from Gaza, one day after the announcement of the martyr Ashraf Abu Warda. The martyrs are: Mohammed Rashid Akka (44 years old), Samir Mahmoud Al-Kahlout (52 years old), Zuhair Omar Al-Sharif (58 years old), and Mohammed Anwar Labad (57 years old), bringing the number of martyrs announced during the past 24 hours to five martyrs.

The Prisonersx Authority and The Prisoners' Club noted that we received the news of Akka's martyrdom through the General Authority for Civil Affairs, while the family of the martyr Al-Kahlout received the news of his martyrdom through the Hamoked Foundation, the martyr Al-Sharif through a private lawyer who obtained a paper proving his martyrdom in Ramla Prison, and the martyr Labad through the Hamoked Foundation. 

The Prisoners' Authority and The Prisoners' Club stated that all of these responses received by the various institutions were obtained from the occupation army or the occupation prison administration, and we confirm that this is the only available way to reveal the fate of the Gaza detainees that was made possible by the legal amendments. 

The Prisoners' Authority and The Prisoners' Club explained that the martyr Akka was arrested on 11/15/2023 during his displacement from northern Gaza to the south. He's married and the father of ten children, and according to his family, he did not suffer from any health problems. He was ascended to martyrdom in the Negev Prison yesterday. 

As for the martyr Al-Kahlout, he was arrested on 10/25/2024, from Kamal Adwan Hospital. Before his arrest, he had undergone an operation to remove parts of his liver and kidneys, and he needed intensive care. His health condition worsened due to the simple medical capabilities. Despite the doctors’ attempts to prevent the soldiers from arresting him, they arrested him by force, and he passed away on 11/3/2024, a week after his arrest. It is worth noting that he's married and the father of three children. 

The martyr Al-Sharif has been detained since 10/7/2023, as he was arrested while working in the occupied territories in 1948. He's married and has six children. According to his family, he did not suffer from any health problems. He was martyred on 10/18/2023. Here, we point out that the occupation army is trying to manipulate the responses that followed the lawyer’s response, despite obtaining a paper confirming his martyrdom in Ramla prison. The process of manipulating the responses was represented by the army giving us another response stating that he had been released from Ofer prison, and another response stating that there were no authorities to give a response regarding his fate. This case is one of several cases that the institutions followed up on, which showed the occupation army’s deliberate manipulation of the responses.

The martyr Labad was arrested on 11/18/2024, during his displacement from the north to the south with his family. He is married and has eight children. Before his arrest, he suffered from liver cirrhosis and diabetes. He was ascended to martyrdom on 11/27/2024. 

The Prisoners' Authority and the Prisoners' Club said that the increase in the number of martyred prisoners is an escalating humanitarian disaster, and a new confirmation of what we warned about, that the occupation, without the slightest regard for all of humanity, is working to liquidate prisoners in a systematic and public manner.**

Statement to the Palestinian people regarding the practices of the Authority in Jenin.

⚫️ Issued by the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine:

Based on the firm positions and solid principles upon which the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine was founded, and which it has adhered to throughout its journey, and which everyone near and far testifies that it has never deviated from,

In light of the unjust campaign targeting our movement, its cadres and symbols, with the aim of provoking it and dragging it into a cycle of rejected internal fighting,
And based on our deep concern to abide by the will of our Palestinian people, as the owner of legitimacy and the final decision, we present to Palestinian public opinion the following facts:

Since the launch of the security campaign carried out by the Authority's security forces in the Jenin camp, our movement has been subjected to a systematic media campaign aimed at distorting its path, casting doubt on its national affiliation, and denying its honorable history and great sacrifices. This campaign has reached the level of personal attacks on the movement's leaders and symbols. Despite all this, we affirm our adherence to refusing to be dragged into internal strife, not out of weakness or inability, but rather out of commitment to our principles, to preserve the blood of our people, and in appreciation of the sacrifices of the martyrs, wounded, and prisoners. We are fully aware that these provocations aim to drag us into the quagmire of strife, which we will not enter.

Our brothers and sons in the Jenin Brigade have also been subjected, for weeks, to a fierce campaign of arrests, pursuits, and shooting, amidst a media and security siege aimed at undermining their resolve. These practices aim to push us into internal conflict, which only serves the zionist occupation that incites strife, aiming to portray our Palestinian people as being in a state of internal fighting, to pass its narrative and justify its crimes against Gaza before the world.

From the first moment, we took the initiative to put forward numerous initiatives and mediations with the aim of sparing our people the scourge of strife and stopping the bloodshed. Despite our keenness to prevail wisdom, all these initiatives were thwarted, and the doors were closed to all peaceful solutions.

Events have taken a dangerous turn with the escalation of campaigns of repression and abuse practiced by the authorities against citizens who express their opinions rejecting sedition. These practices, which aim to silence voices calling for wisdom and reason, constitute a flagrant violation of freedom of expression and contradict the sanctity of Palestinian blood.

Based on the above, we emphasize the following:
1 - We demand that the Palestinian Authority immediately stop its security and media campaigns, lift the siege on Jenin camp, end the persecution of resistance fighters, and stop the abuse of citizens.
2 - We commend the positions of our brothers in the Palestinian forces and factions who presented initiatives to lift the siege on Jenin and the efforts and endeavors they made to quell the strife and stop the bloodshed of our people, and to thwart the occupation, and we call on them to redouble their efforts.
3 - We call on our brothers in the Fatah movement, with whom we share the path of struggle and resistance, to intervene urgently to stop the voices that insult their honorable history of struggle, and to redirect the compass towards our national unity.
4 - We appeal to the dignitaries and national leaders, from various political and societal movements, to play their role in protecting Palestinian blood and working to find a way out that preserves the unity of our people.
As we address our people, we renew our firm commitment to preserving our national unity and our absolute rejection of all forms of sedition that serve the occupation alone.**",171.0,2.0,0,False

Sharaa, in turn, said while meeting with Jumblatt that ""Syria was a source of concern and disturbance and its interference in Lebanese affairs was negative, and the Syrian regime killed Kamal Jumblatt, Bashir Gemayel and Rafik Hariri.” 

""The coming Syria in the new era stands at an equal distance from everyone in Lebanon and will not be a case of negative interference in Lebanon at all,” Sharaa vowed. 

HTS, formerly known as Al-Qaeda’s Nusra Front, was responsible for the killing and kidnapping of Lebanese army soldiers during the first years of the war in Syria. It also occupied large swathes of the barrens of Arsal and Ras Baalbek in northern Lebanon, and carried out deadly attacks on Lebanese civilians. 

Prior to the formation of the Nusra Front in 2012, Julani was a member of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), the group which evolved into ISIS – also responsible for numerous atrocities in Lebanon.",221.0,3.0,0,True

Important statement issued by Saraya Al-Quds - West Bank:

O sons of our Arab and Palestinian people everywhere,
O sons of the cities that have bled and are still bleeding martyrs, O our loyal towns, O our strong fortress, O sons of the camps, the incubator of resistance.

The time has come for the message to be delivered. The time has come for us to rise up to stop the Palestinian bloodshed and reject the siege of Jenin camp, and in solidarity with our people in Gaza.

The blood is the blood of our people and our duty is to stop its bleeding.

We call on you to declare a general strike and mobilization at the public intersections, today immediately after the Maghrib prayer.

We also call on the free people of Jenin and its camps, the surrounding towns and villages, as well as everyone who can reach Jenin camp, to go out in mass marches towards Jenin camp to lift the siege on the camp and on the heroes of the camp and to end this era that only serves the occupation and its extremist government in its greed for annexation and settlement expansion in the West Bank.

This mobilization is the least moral and religious duty we can perform to stop the bloodshed of the Palestinians, to support the Jenin camp and its resistance, and to defend the pure blood that has been shed by our besieged brothers in the Gaza Strip, who are under the injustice and fire of this brutal enemy.

Allah is behind the intention, Allah is the Grantor of success and praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.

Our fighting continues and our weapons are drawn in all arenas.

With the highest verses of jihad, resistance, pride and dignity, the leadership of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades announces

its martyr, the fighting leader,** [**Tariq Al-Doush**](https://t.me/resistancechain/9561?single)**
Commander of the Rapid Response Brigade in Tulkarem
who was assassinated by the hand of treachery and betrayal this evening, Thursday, in the steadfast Tulkarem, along with a group of heroic fighters, namely,

The martyr fighter, Dossam Sufyan Al-Awfi
The martyr fighter, Mohammed Nafez Rahaymeh
The martyr fighter, Hamoudi Al-Awfi

These are our heroes who made the treacherous enemy taste the flames of their bullets and manufactured explosive devices with their pure hands.

Yes, a martyr fell from us, but the rifle did not and will not fall. Shame on those who owned the weapon and bowed down. Shame on those who sold out and failed. Shame on everyone who retreated and surrendered. This martyr is our martyr, and this blood that was shed is our blood, and this revenge is our revenge. We will respond in kind. Your aspirations have failed and all your conspiracies will fall, and you will lose your bet. We are not broken, but we break.

We are not terrified, but we terrify.

{They said, 'We have no power today against Goliath and his soldiers.' But those who were certain they would meet Allah said, 'How many a small force has overcome a large force by permission of Allah. And Allah is with the patient.'}

Rest in peace, our beloved Tariq.

I swear by He who spread out the earth and raised the sky without pillars, your blood will not be in vain.

Peace be upon you as you fought, as you clashed, as you persevered, and as you were martyred.
Our martyr and leader has a right over us.
Our martyr fighter carried out many painful attacks against the occupation, inflicting direct injuries to the occupation soldiers in several qualitative operations in Tulkarem and its axes. The enemy has kept it secret in the media as it always does, and we say to them, keep it secret as you wish, but we will plant terror in your hearts. We will strike you in all parts of the homeland. We will strike you wherever you are. We will strike you in your homes. 

To our people in steadfast Tulkarem, all of the West Bank, and proud Gaza:
O you who have been patient until patience itself ran out, we will not rest and our consolation will not subside until we achieve our revenge, God willing.

Glory and eternity to the righteous martyrs.

Healing for our brave wounded.

Freedom for our heroic prisoners.

• What did the enemy achieve through its aggression on Lebanon? It assassinated Hezbollah leaders, including the martyr Sayyed, and committed heinous crimes against civilians. However, it failed to break the stronghold of the resistance, and its actions do not qualify as achievements.

• The enemy has realized that a confrontation with Hezbollah is futile and will not lead to its victory, prompting it to resort to a ceasefire agreement.

• We endured hundreds of Israeli violations during this period to facilitate the agreement's implementation, expose the enemy, and hold all of the concerned parties before their responsibilities.

• In Hezbollah, we monitor developments and act according to our assessment of the interests and unfolding events.

• The legitimacy of the resistance stems from its faith in its cause, regardless of its capabilities.

• Victory lies in steadfastness and the continuity of this resistance.

• Hezbollah's resistance continues with faith and preparation.

• We do not know when the resistance will ultimately defeat this occupier. It sometimes wins and sometimes faces setbacks, but the essential aspect is its perseverance and presence on the battlefield.

• Victory is maintaining the resistance and ignoring the discordant voices that reflect despair and reactionary behavior.

• We say: come to a resistance that has proven its effectiveness and demonstrated that this enemy cannot withdraw except through resistance.

• This aggression was stopped at the borders through the solidarity of our people and loved ones.

• Every phase has its own methods and approaches; some changes occurred, but the key is for the resistance to endure.

• The enemy is contemplating settlements in Gaza and the annexation of the West Bank, backed entirely by the US.

• They have destroyed all the Syrian army’s capabilities under various pretexts, which clearly reflects their expansionist agenda, aiming to extend their reach to all Arab countries.

• We must continue with the resistance, as it, alongside the army and the people, prevented the enemy’s expansion into Lebanon.

• Hezbollah is strong and recovering from its wounds; those who hoped for its end have been disappointed.

• Our upcoming agenda includes implementing the agreement south of the Litani River, reconstruction efforts, and electing a president.

• We hope for cooperation between Syria and Lebanon governments and people.

• As part of our agenda, we advocate for positive dialogue on contentious issues, including: ""What is Lebanon’s position on the Israeli occupation of its land? How do we strengthen the Lebanese army? What is Lebanon’s defense strategy?""

• We hope that the new ruling entity in Syria will regard ""Israel"" as an enemy.

• The regime in Syria fell at the hands of new forces that we cannot judge until they stabilize, take clear positions, and regulate their situation.

• Hezbollah has lost a military supply route in this phase, but this is a detail—we can explore alternative routes.

• It is essential to reassess after these significant developments in the region, and we hope the outcomes will be positive.",186.0,1.0,0,False

We condemn the continued pursuit of resistance fighters and those wanted by the occupation by the Authority's security services, and we condemn the escalating and deliberate targeting of them in Jenin, which is completely in line with the aggression and criminality of the occupation, without any regard to all the calls to stop its actions against our people and our resistance fighters.

We call on all our factions, national forces and all components of our people to take a decisive stance against what the Authority's apparatuses are doing throughout the West Bank, especially in Jenin, and to put serious pressure on them to put an end to these serious violations that threaten our national fabric and societal stability.

We also call on the Authority's leadership to curb the behavior of its apparatuses and immediately and completely stop these shameful attacks, and to expedite the release of all political prisoners from its prisons, and to correct its moral and national compass towards the option of unity and resistance to deter the occupation and repel its aggression.

We call on our people to respond to the call issued by our sons in Saraya Al-Quds and the Jenin Brigade and to demonstrate to express their rejection, resentment and anger at what the Authority and its apparatuses are doing, which exposes the future of the West Bank and its people to the risk of leaving it prey to settler gangs and the occupation army.

Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of tyranny. So fight the allies of Satan. Indeed, the plot of Satan has ever been weak. [An-Nisa:76]
This is the truth of Allah Almighty.

We mourn the martyrs of Jenin camp this morning at the hands of the security forces, may Allah have mercy on them.

Kill your anger before you harm your brother.

Kill your hatred before you destroy yourself.

Kill your ignorance before you destroy your society.

Kill your betrayal before your honor is violated.

Kill your selfishness before your pride is humiliated.

Kill your ego before you kill your homeland.

Our final message to the sons of the security forces:

There is no traitor who was born a traitor, but he could easily become one if he was born and raised in a treacherous environment and was not rescued early by a free hand from this mire, for a traitor will not raise a son on freedom, loyalty and patriotism, and a free person will not raise his children on slavery and submission. 
Treason does not have to be a bullet that kills your brother, but merely accepting the oppressor - ""the occupier"" - and the reality he produced could be the starting point for treason.

To be free means to reject a reality imposed by your occupier, to stand against him and defend your freedom and fight for what you believe in, and if everyone lies, do not lie to yourself and kill in your soul the instinct and idea that you were born free. This will take you off the right path and cloud your mind and you will start to fall, and little by little you may find yourself not owning yourself, to become the king of your lie and their lie, defending your opponent and an opponent of what you should be, ""free""!  In the end, you will die of your betrayal, and the idea remains clear, alive and fragrant.

The authorities must back down from their unpatriotic decisions that only serve the occupation. The blood of our martyrs is on your necks.

You will not be able to undermine our resolve or disarm us.

O sons of our Arab and Palestinian people everywhere
O you who are bound by the love of the land and the longing for its soil to return free from the arrogance and aggression of the occupation.

The time has come for your great message to reach the enemy and its supporters that resistance is our approach in defending our people and the free people of our nation.

The blood is the blood of our people and prayer is a pillar of our religion and the enemy has touched both of them.
We call upon you, our people in cities, villages and the towns of the West Bank to strike, declare general mobilization, declare a day of rage and participate in a popular demonstration under the title,

**""The blood of the martyrs unites us and the enemy lies in wait for us""**

This mobilization is the least moral and legal duty we perform towards stopping the Palestinian blood and supporting the Jenin camp, the incubator of resistance in the West Bank, and in support of the pure blood that was shed by our brothers besieged in the Gaza Strip and languishing under the injustice and fire of this brutal enemy.

And Allah is behind the intention and Allah is the Grantor of success and praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.

In a significant development, calls from supporters of the Saudi-Emirati coalition to escalate the Syrian scenario in Yemen have resurfaced, with factions such as the Al-Islah Party, Yemen’s Muslim Brotherhood affiliate, urging military action against Ansar Allah (Houthis). This reflects growing resistance to the UN-backed ceasefire and efforts to implement the Saudi-Sana’a peace roadmap agreed upon late last year. From Istanbul, the “Revolutionary Youth Council,” affiliated with Islah, explicitly called for military escalation, citing the Syrian experience as a model. These calls have exposed growing divisions within coalition-aligned factions, with the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) distancing itself from such initiatives.

The UN has reiterated the importance of preserving Yemen’s ceasefire and isolating it from regional conflicts. Ahead of a UN Security Council session, Special Envoy Hans Grundberg stressed the necessity of confidence-building measures to sustain peace and resume dialogue.

On the international stage, the EU rejected a new request from Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council for military support in securing Red Sea navigation, underscoring global consensus against a return to war. US envoy Tim Lenderking’s visits to Djibouti, Qatar, and Bahrain signal Washington’s intent to escalate tensions on Yemen’s western coast, particularly around Hudaydah, under the pretext of safeguarding international navigation and defending Israel amid Gaza’s ongoing crisis.

In response, Sana’a has escalated its military actions. It announced naval operations targeting US ships in the Gulf of Aden and airstrikes on Israeli territory. CENTCOM confirmed that Yemeni forces had recently targeted US naval fleets with ballistic missiles and drones, marking a significant escalation. Despite US efforts, skepticism remains over the ability of fractured coalition-aligned forces to carry out effective military campaigns.

We have always warned against ""israeli"" ambitions across the region and resisted them to prevent the occupation from achieving its goals. We have repeatedly stated that the aggression against Gaza is a genocidal war and a starting point for reshaping the region and ending the Palestinian cause.

The complete Arab, Islamic, and international silence before the criminal aggression against Syria, backed by unlimited American support, and the failure to take practical measures to confront this aggression and support the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights, has led to increased Zionist encroachment on the countries of the region.

All necessary measures must be taken to prevent the ""israeli"" entity from achieving its objectives, and there must be no silence or passive observation of this brutal aggression against Syria and its people. What is happening in Syria today, both at the popular and political levels, and the resulting internal and external political choices, is an exclusive right of the Syrian people, free from any external influences or pressures.

We hope that Syria will stabilize through the choices of its own people, achieve its renaissance, and take a firm stance against the ""israeli"" occupation, preventing external interference in its affairs.

The zionist entity is an enemy to all Muslims, targeting Sunnis, Shias, and all Islamic sects and denominations.**

**The enemies strive to fuel conflicts in Arab and Islamic countries, aiming to erase Palestine from the sphere of concern.**

At this critical moment, certain major Islamic regimes are seeking to demonstrate loyalty to Trump ahead of his return to the White House by stirring divisions within the nation.

**The slogans of “liberating the Levant” should have been directed toward supporting the Palestinian people in their profound suffering and dire oppression.**

**The holiest land in the Levant is Palestine, encompassing Al-Aqsa Mosque and Al-Quds. Why do those claiming to act under the banner of liberation, and their supporters, not move to liberate Palestine?**

**The zionist enemy is the worst adversary of the nation. Is it not a priority to save the Palestinian people from zionist oppression and crimes?**

Some regimes are seeking to appease Trump preemptively by destroying nations and serving the enemy’s interests, a deeply unfortunate trend.

**The Islamic nation must not accept distractions that divert it from its vital, central cause—the plight of Palestine—which must remain a constant priority.
**
The U.S. and ""israel"" aim to eliminate the Palestinian cause by diverting attention, targeting its supporters, and opening multiple fronts to exhaust the nation.

RNN has provided translated highlights below (1/2):
—
At the end of the second month of the second year, the enemy continues its brutal aggression in the Gaza Strip, committing crimes without pause.
 
Over 25 massacres were committed by the enemy this week, resulting in nearly a thousand casualties among the Palestinian people, including crimes targeting displaced persons’ camps yesterday.

**The toll of zionist aggression on Gaza to date exceeds 180,000 martyrs, wounded, missing persons, and captives.**

The Americans exploit wars against our nation, directly or through their proxies, to test their prohibited weapons and measure their effectiveness in exterminating people.

**The enemy continues to use starvation as a tool of extermination, with UNRWA confirming that aid entering Gaza amounts to only 6% of the population’s needs.**

The enemy’s crimes persist in the West Bank against the Palestinian people, alongside attacks on Islamic holy sites.

Among the worst and most dangerous zionist crimes violating the sanctity of Islamic holy sites is the desecration of the Holy Quran.

The United States is the other face of zionism, with similar criminal practices shared between America and “israel.”

The presence of zionist captives in Gaza is a major issue the U.S. cannot tolerate, as it seeks to ensure that this nation remains subjugated to the zionist enemy.

The Islamic nation must learn from events, draw lessons, and deepen its awareness and understanding of what is happening and the threats it faces.

The enemies strive to make our nation forget or overlook the truths about them and to manipulate it with misleading narratives and lies.

**The nation must firmly believe in the truth of the Quran, “Falsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it” (Quran 41:42), and classify its enemies in light of its teachings.**

**It is deeply troubling that some within our nation rely on the Americans and zionists to dictate who they should consider an enemy.**

Another evident reality during this zionist aggression has been the severe neglect and abdication of responsibility by much of the Islamic nation.

For over a year and two months, most Muslims have been mere spectators, taking no practical action whatsoever against the zionist enemy.

Some non-Muslim countries in Latin America have taken stronger stances against the zionist enemy than many Muslim-majority countries, which is deeply regrettable.

**Major Arab and Islamic nations have stood by idly in the face of events in Palestine, offering little beyond statements and declarations without practical measures.

Arab summits produce no more than statements and declarations that have no lasting impact or actionable follow-up.

Arab and Islamic regimes have not allowed their peoples to mobilize in support of the Palestinian people; instead, they have restricted and suppressed them.
**
**The sole glimmer of hope amidst the darkness of Arab and Islamic betrayal lies in the efforts of the Al-Quds axis, jihad, and resistance.

Hezbollah has sacrificed immensely for the sake of Palestine, offering its leaders and cadres as martyrs in the path of Allah, achieving what others have not.

The support coming from Yemen and Iraq is evident against the backdrop of the immense Arab and Islamic abandonment.

The Islamic Republic of Iran provides support and assistance to the entire axis, with the Palestinian people at the forefront.**

Certain Arab media outlets actively undermine support for the Palestinian people, discouraging the nation from taking any action.

Those aligned with America and “israel” are required to ensure no support reaches the Palestinian people or their fighters.

As Palestinian factions meet in Cairo, the PA in Ramallah is -- as it always has been since its creation under the Oslo accords -- arresting Palestinians under ""security coordination"" with the occupation, shooting at resistance fighters and dismantling resistance weapons.

This aims to prevent the resistance in the West Bank from carrying out a large-scale confrontation of the occupation, standing with Gaza and the people throughout Palestine, and from defending their land and people from colonial settlers. Of course, it also aims to prevent Palestinian unity.

This morning, PA ""security"" forces abducted Raheeb and Mohammed Daraghmeh (photos 1 and 2) after besieging their homes in Al-Jisr neighbourhood in Tubas, part of the PA's ongoing attacks on the resistance in Tubas and its popular cradle (acting alongside Zionist assassinations and invasions.) This has involved repeatedly dismantling explosive devices created by the resistance in order to confront the invading occupation forces and multiple threats against the resistance.

For Palestinian students, the PA prisons are a ""revolving door"" with the occupation. When released by the occupation, they are detained by the PA; and vice versa. At least four of the students arrested in the past week by the occupation were recently detained in the Palestinian Authority's notorious jails. Yesterday, the PA ""security"" abducted Birzeit student Hudhayfa Ammar Abu Zneid from his university dorm. (photo 3)

One day before, the PA intelligence services in al-Khalil abducted Polytechnic University student Muhannad Mahmoud Amr (photo 4), from Dura, after summoning him for interrogation at the Al-Khalil PA intelligence headquarters.

PA ""security"" forces (who provide security only for the occupation) arrested Palestinian journalist Hammam Attili (photo 6) from his workplace in Attil, north of Tulkarem, at the same time the zionist regime carries out an arrest and assassination campaign against Palestinian journalists.

Only two weeks after he was released from PA detention in Nablus, the PA once again abducted Rami Dweikat on 30 November. He has launched a hunger strike to demand his freedom. (photo 7)

These are only those most recently detained by the ""security forces."" Since 7 October 2023, the PA has detained 1,800 Palestinians for ""security"" reasons — that is, suspicion of resisting the occupation, being held as political prisoners — while providing absolutely no security to the Palestinian people confronting violent illegal settlers and the occupation army on a daily basis.

Yesterday, the PA ""security forces"" attacked and opened fire on members of the Tulkarem Brigade of Saraya al-Quds in Tulkarem, who were able to escape. (The PA's forces previously assassinated Brigade martyrs Ahmed Abu al-Foul and Moatassem al-Arif.)

Of course, this is nothing new. The Palestinian Authority was created in order to provide security for the colonizer and create a local agent to act in its interests, rather than to protect and liberate the Palestinian people.

From Muhyi al-Din al Sharif to Ahmad Sa'adat to today's detainees, the treacherous PA imprisoned many leaders of the resistance in order to serve the Zionist occupation and its imperialist backers in the US, EU, Canada, etc. Free all Palestinian prisoners in PA, Zionist & imperialist jails!",227.0,2.0,0,True

Advancing and not retreating, the two martyrs were ascended after an armed clash described as one of ""the most violent and longest"" clashes with the zionist special forces and their snipers who stormed Al-Hadaf neighborhood in Jenin. After discovering the presence of the special forces, the resistance fighters set out to besiege them. A large forces of the zionist occupation army estimated at 35 military vehicles stormed the camp and their army clashed with the resistance fighters, until their martyrdom. 

Martyr Mohammed Al-Saadi “Abu Al-Ayman"" was a prominent commander in Saraya Al-Quds - Jenin Brigade, the resistance movement he belonged since his early age. He was a close friend of the inspiring martyr Jamil Al-Amouri and grew up together with him to live the stories of heroism as a legacy that is difficult to lose. After the martyrdom of Jamil Al-Amouri, Abu Al-Ayman emerged as his friend’s blood guardian. He began taking more vital part in organizing the ranks and recruiting young men, as told by his friend to Al-Akhbar. 

Abu Al-Ayman was known for his simplicity and honesty. He expressed himself with the utmost simplicity (both in speech and personality) that can be understood by everyone, absolute humility and high morale. Everyone loved him because he was a true leader. Within two years of his leadership in the camp, zionist occupation army placed him on the wanted list. He was also a freed prisoner after three years of detention, survived several assassination attempts and was wounded three times with various injuries. 

In the movement, martyr Mohammed Al-Saadi was more than a Field Commander, he also served as a bridge. He was a listener and delivered the concern of every internal problem to unifying social figures who would be creative in solving it. After that, he would intervene in his cheerful, brotherly style, to restore cohesion between the people.

Another beautiful story about him was the martyr Abu Al-Ayman as a dutiful son to his father. His friend said, 
""I have not found anyone more dutiful to his father than him, nor more compassionate to his family than him. He was afflicted with the loss of his father after his father was diagnosed with cancer two years ago, and his resistance work did not distract him from taking care of him. He would return home in the middle of the night several times to kiss his father’s hands.""

Thousands have gathered at the __Light from Light__ event to bid farewell to their beloved leader, the Sayyed of the nation’s martyrs, His Eminence, the martyr, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. With hearts heavy with grief yet filled with pride and the deepest of love, the masses raise candles, hold his pictures high, and chant slogans of loyalty and resistance. The flag of victory waves as they converge on the site of his ascension to martyrdom in Haret Hriek, in Beirut’s Dahyeh (southern suburb).

Al-Mayadeen correspondent Ali Mortada reported (media 6):
""In front of you on your screens, to the whole world and every viewer of Al-Mayadeen, are these people who have lost their homes, lost their siblings, lost their families, lost their livelihoods, lost their mothers, and lost their brothers. These are the people whom the enemy expected to break. Today, they stand at the site of the martyrdom of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah to say to him: __As you always promised us, O Sayyed, with constant victory, here we are fulfilling your promise. We came with victory once again, and again, and again.__

There is no message today greater than the spirit of the Sayyed, which flows here among us. We hear his words with both ears, and we see this soil, mixed with his blood, protecting us.

Here rose the martyr of the nation; here rose the great, global leader and fighter. Here rose the leader who laid out Lebanon’s liberation since 1982, through the battle of ’93, through the battle of ’96, through the victory of 2000 and the liberation, through the victory of 2006, and through the victory of 2024.

Here, the spirit of the man who guided us on the path to freedom ascended. Here, he listens to us and is present among us as we chant: __At your service, at your service, O Nasrallah!__”

The loss is immense, yet we are reminded of the Sayyed’s enduring faith in Allah, who grants victory to the steadfast and his faith in the masses—those who refuse to lower the banner of justice and liberation, no matter the cost. Today, though orphaned by his absence, they remain on the path he paved, the path of sacrifice, dignity, and resistance, marching towards Al-Quds.

Following the [attack by terrorist groups on the city of Aleppo](https://t.me/PalestineResist/70273), the Party affirms that what is happening in northern Syria runs parallel to the Jewish scheme in the south. The timing of the attack's launch undeniably proves that the terrorist groups are operating under the orders of the occupation forces.

[**__Mohammed Jamal Al-Zubaidi, ""Al-Nish"".__**](https://t.me/PalestineResist/21171)**__
The first anniversary:__**

A prominent leader in the Jenin Brigade, he was born on April 1, 1997, and was martyred at the age of 26. He was born and raised in the Jenin refugee camp, where he always sought and wished for martyrdom. Everyone attested to his bravery. [He once said, ""The youth have high morale; we are going to be martyred on the land of this camp. Deliver this message to all the Jews.""](https://t.me/PalestineResist/47395)

**Mohammed was born into a family of fighters. **

His brother, Naeem, was martyred when he was young, and his cousin Zakaria is still imprisoned, while his cousin Dawood was martyred and was the one who gave Mohammed the nickname ""Al-Nish."" Mohammed joined the resistance at the age of 15, crafting explosives and firing at occupation checkpoints. His family only learned of his involvement when he was first arrested.  

**Mohammed was among the best of the youth.**

His family and the residents of the camp testify to that. His brother, Yousef, said: ""Mohammed was beloved, cheerful, and loved children.""
His father, Jamal, added: ""He was a simple, always smiling person with good relations with his friends.""

**All of his friends shared his love for the homeland.  **

They were united by their devotion to the homeland and their struggle in its cause. Some walked in his funeral, while others were martyred alongside him, including the commander of the brigade, Wissam Hanoun, known as ""Abu Watan."" Wissam once said that they had no time to sleep, spending most of their time preparing explosives and setting ambushes.

The occupation failed to break Mohammed's resilience. He was injured three times, yet each time he left the hospital, he immediately took up his weapon again. When he was assassinated, only a week had passed since his last injury. 

**""We are going to be martyred on the land of this camp. Deliver this message to all the Jews.""**

Notes: The status of Wissam Hanoun ""Abu Watan"" remains unclear as the [occupation courts are concealing his fate](https://t.me/PalestineResist/70198) and are not revealing wether he is in the occupation's prisons, or hospitals, or ascended as a martyr.

—
Hezbollah stood firm on the frontlines and began targeting the enemy’s internal front, placing ""israel"" in a critical defensive position.

During this war, the number of displaced in ""israel"" rose from 70,000 to hundreds of thousands.

The resistance proved its readiness, with Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah’s plans demonstrating effectiveness and accounting for all developments.  

The occupation relied on inciting internal strife among hosts, but this gamble failed due to cooperation between sects and factions.  

The legendary and sacrificial resilience of the fighters amazed the world, terrified the ""israeli army,"" and instilled despair in the enemy.  

We are facing a great victory as a result of this battle. The enemy failed to destroy Hezbollah or weaken the resistance and was forced to justify its failures to its public.  

The resistance has persisted and will continue. This victory belongs to all who contributed—through sacrifice, injury, prayer, words, or support.  

This victory is for every honorable and free person who supported the resistance and condemned ""israeli"" aggression.

Our support for Palestine will not stop, and it will take various forms.

The enemy is surrounded by defeat. The ceasefire agreement is not a treaty or a new deal requiring state signatures but rather an implementation of Resolution 1701, focused on the area south of the Litani River.  

The agreement’s central focus today is on the area south of the Litani River and the withdrawal of the ""israeli army"" from all occupied areas.  

High-level coordination between the resistance and the Lebanese army will ensure the agreement's execution.  

No one should bet on discord between Hezbollah and the army, as this agreement falls under Lebanese sovereignty.

Gratitude is extended to the resistance fighters who humiliated the enemy and faced it with legendary resilience.  

Gratitude is also given to the martyrs who paved the path to strength and dignity, rejecting humiliation and prioritizing resistance.  

We thank the Islamic Republic of Iran, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei for his guidance and support, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and the martyr Qassem Soleimani, who laid the foundation and built this path. Gratitude is also extended to the compassionate Iranian people.

The agreement stipulates a total zionist withdrawal from Lebanese territory, restoring Lebanese sovereignty while notably preserving Hezbollah’s strength and resources in the country.

The zionist army, in spite of its destructive capability and bloodthirsty practices, found itself unable to dismantle the steadfast resistance, born from and consisting of the unbreakable righteous people of Lebanon. 

From October 8 until today, the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon has worked tirelessly to support its oppressed brothers and sisters in Gaza. They launched thousands of operations against the zionist entity, announcing 3,763 of them in official statements. They killed and wounded thousands of zionist soldiers, and displaced over 200,000 settlers in a bound towards the final liberation. The Lebanese resistance and its people sacrificed everything, from fighters to homes, men, women, children, and the martyr leader, Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Over 4,000 martyrs have ascended in Lebanon throughout the course of this war, among them 200 paramedics.

As this ceasefire takes effect, hundreds of thousands of displaced Lebanese are already returning to their homes. They will rebuild their homes, bury their martyrs, nurse their wounded, and nurture their children. Through their resistance, they have stood against the forces of evil in the world and lived to write the history of their historic deeds.

__Al-Akhbar report 
 
__The war’s toll on Israel’s northern regions has become a staggering economic burden. With damages exceeding 5 billion shekels ($1.35 billion), the Israeli Tax Authority warns that the figure will only climb without a ceasefire agreement with Lebanon. Direct damage to homes, factories, and infrastructure totals 1.5 billion shekels, while indirect losses—shuttered businesses, halted agriculture, and declining incomes—reach 4 billion shekels, with agriculture and tourism hardest hit. 
 
Factories near the border are closed, and major shipping disruptions have choked supply chains, crippling production. Even in areas farther from the frontlines, workforces have dwindled, operating at barely 50% capacity as missile strikes and sirens disrupt daily life. Over 27 settlements have ceased operations entirely, following Hezbollah's evacuation warnings three weeks ago. 
 
In a blow to Israel's defense industry, precision strikes by Hezbollah drones forced the closure of key military factories, including facilities belonging to ""B.A.T"" and ""Rafael"". These attacks have led to layoffs, factory relocations, and the evacuation of sensitive military sites. The once-bustling real estate market has collapsed, with plummeting demand and over 12,000 families displaced, many now facing up to 18 months in temporary housing.  
 
Interviews with Israeli business owners impacted in the northern regions under occupation emphasized their recognition of the ""need for joint cooperation with the Arab community"" in these areas. These regions are home to over two million people, including approximately 850,000 Arabs who form a vital part of the business and production sectors and a significant consumer base. 
 
The war’s shadow continues to freeze reconstruction, deepen unemployment, and strain resources, threatening to lock the northern economy in paralysis for the foreseeable future.

النقطة الأولى وهي مسألة أنَّ المقاومةَ بخير، وهذا المبدأ لا يتنافى مع وجود التضحيات الجِسام التي تُقدّمها المقاومة بشكلٍ يوميّ إلى جانبِ تضحيات أبناءِ شعبها، فعندما تكونُ المُقاومةُ بخير يعني أنّها تُقف أمام التّحديّات والصّعوبات وأن تقف سدًا منيعًا أمام طموحات العدوّ وأهدافه وتمنعهُ من تحقيقها بشكلٍ مستدام.
هذا الأمر قد يتصوّرهُ البعض نتيجةً لمُغالطَات زُرِعت منذُ أكثر من عشرة أعوام  نتيجةً لكثير من التُرَّهات الإعلاميّة، هو أنَّ مسألة صمود المقاومة مرتبطة بحزب التضحيات، فيما المسألة بالعكس تمامًا، فإنَّ المُقاومة تكونُ بخير عندما تكون تعمل وتسعى لتحقيق أهدافها ويكفي وجودها وبقاءَها دليلٌ على ذلك.  

النقطة الثانية وهي نقطةُ النظرة إلى جيش العدوّ، وهذه من المُعضلات التي عشناها لمدة سنوات كذلك نتيجةً لبعض السّخافات الإعلامّة التي كانت موجودة في أوساطنا والتي تبنّاها الكثير منّا مع الأسف، فإذا كانَ الجيش الإسرائيلي جيشًا هزيلًا فهذا يعني أنّهُ لا قيمة لنفس هذه المُقاومة والإعجاز الذي حققتهُ بكونها مقاومةً موجودةً صامدةً أمام هذا الجيش يعني أنّ هذا الجيش هو جيشٌ متين وهو بالأصل كذلك فهو يمتلك التفوّق التّقني والتكنولوجي والتّسليحي والمدد غير  المحدود من العالمِ كلّه، وصولًا إلى بعض الأنظمةِ العربيةِ السخيفة التي لا تمتلك حتى قرارها. 

المسألة الثّالثة والأهم وهي مسألةُ اليقين التّام بأنّ النّصر يتحقق بتحقُق أهداف المُقاومة، فلا يُقنعنّكُم أحدٌ بأن هذا النّصر يوم يتحقق سيكون عكس ذلك، هذه المُقاومة وهذه القيادة أمينة على التضحيات التي قُدّمت وهي التضحيات الجسامُ العظامُ الكبار.
إنّ قيادة المقاومة أمينة على هذه التضحيات وتعرف كيف وأين وعلى ماذا تُفاوض، وكيف يمكن أن يكون النّسق الذي سيخرج فيه الإتّفاق حين خروجه، وإلى ذلك الحين نسألُ الله الثّبات لأُمّتنا وشعبنا العزيز وللبيئةِ الشريفة المُضحية التي ما تركت المقاومة وما وخذلتها، بل وحتّى كانت هي السّند والحُصُن وغمد السّيف حتى في أصعب الظروف.",234.0,0.0,0,False

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,

""Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah. Some of them have fulfilled their vow, and some are still waiting, and they have not changed in the least.""  
This is the Truth of Allah the Almighty.

We mourn to the nation of resistance and resistance media, the nation of martyrs and fighters, a great media leader and a great martyr on the path to Al-Quds, [Hajj Mohammed Afif al-Nabulsi](https://t.me/PalestineResist/68831), the head of media relations in Hezbollah, who departed to be with his Lord with the best of his fighter brothers in a criminal and aggressive zionist airstrike, after an honorable journey in the arenas of jihad and resistance media work.

Hajj Muhammad Afif joined, as he long to, his comrades-in-arms, his beloved and his ""father"" whom he loved to call by this name, the supreme martyr, [His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah](https://t.me/PalestineResist/66371). He derived strength from his wisdom, and vision, insight and light from his guidance. He was an example of a loyal brother, a strong supporter, a trustee of the voice of the resistance, and a fundamental pillar in Hezbollah’s media, political and jihadist march.

He was not intimidated by the enemy’s death threats, he faced them with great courage and his famous phrase: “The bombing did not scare us, so how can the threats scare us?” With his usual courage, he insisted on a bold media presence to confront the ""israeli"" media machine, convey the voice of the resistance and its position, and clearly outlined the features of the ongoing battle through his live appearances in the heart of the southern suburbs of Beirut.

With his brilliant, luminous pen and brave stances, he drew the letters of glory and victories, instilling horror in the hearts of the enemy. With the strings of his voice, he composed the melody of death for their [weak house](https://t.me/PalestineResist/6535). The rifle of his words struck them down, and his sword-like voice broke their tyranny. He conveyed what the [Karbalai](https://t.me/PalestineResist/62183) warriors were doing in the battlefield, and chronicled their epics in the media. He was truly the lion of the media field, and he was the one who loudly chanted in the ears and hearts of the enemy, saying: “Resistance is a nation, and a nation never dies.”

We offer our condolences to the Master of the Age and Time [Imam Mahdi], may Allah Almighty hasten his noble reappearance, to His Eminence the Guardian of the Muslims, may God protect him, to the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, [His Eminence Sheikh Naim Qassem](https://t.me/PalestineResist/65683), may Allah protect him, to his brothers, the fighters in the Islamic Resistance, and to his honorable, patient and steadfast family.

**—**
Since the beginning of the aggression, the female prisoners have endured compounded suffering due to the escalation of abuse and the denial of their most basic rights by the prison administration. This is in addition to the exploitation of their cases by some lawyers who have profited from them, whether by taking on their representation or facilitating visits.

**The current situation summarized:**

**- One change of clothing per prisoner:** The prison administration bargained with the prisoners by offering them a single winter outfit in exchange for confiscating their summer clothing. The outfit is of poor-quality fabric, shrinking with washing and fraying easily. Even a ""half needle""—a broken needle the prisoners used to mend their clothing—was confiscated during one of last month's raids.

**- Scarce and poor-quality food:** The administration continues to provide food that is both insufficient in quantity and substandard in quality, leading to issues such as constipation and hormonal imbalances among the prisoners.

**- Sick prisoners without proper treatment:** The unbearable conditions of imprisonment for a healthy detainee are doubly harsh for those suffering from illnesses. There is no doctor to treat them nor appropriate medication. The jailers deliberately replace proper treatment with a single ""Acamol"" pill or sedative injections.

**- Punishment for the simplest acts:** The prison administration punishes prisoners for minor actions such as delays in using the bathroom or even for laughing together as they try to lift their spirits through conversation or games. Punishments include being denied outdoor time for days, cell raids, strip searches, beatings, and confiscation of the few possessions they have left in their rooms.

**- Deprived of cleaning supplies:** There is no laundry detergent available, only dish soap. They have had no nail clippers for nearly a month, and only one comb is available in the entire section. Some prisoners are now suffering from fungal infections on their skin and scalp due to these conditions.

**- Exploitation by lawyers:** Since the beginning of the aggression and the suspension of family visits, some lawyers have exploited families by charging exorbitant amounts to facilitate visits with the prisoners. This is compounded by the poor treatment of some lawyers and their failure to deliver even simple messages between the prisoners and their families.

The suffering is indescribable, and the conditions are unbearable. **Yet, the prisoners, as one witness says, ""are incredibly strong."" They draw their strength from their closeness to Allah, filling their days with prayer, recitation of the Quran, and fasting. They remain resilient, but this does not absolve every one of their duty to advocate for and support them.**",141.0,0.0,0,False

Since 2014, he has held his position, after joining Hezbollah in its foundation in 1983, creating the media arm of the resistance that we see today. Over 40 years, Afif was a fighter on the media front, notably in the 2006 war and in the Battle of the Mighty Ones, where his defiance shined in light of zionist threats.

Al-Manar mourned him: **__""A life spent on the path to Al-Quds, a voice boldly proclaiming resistance, a bright mind, a distinguished journalist, and now a blessed martyr. Many titles and roles embodied in one figure: an advisor, a director, a leader, and a media pioneer—he was, above all, Al-Hajj Mohammad Afif. One of the voices of resistance that will not be silenced by martyrdom but will grow stronger alongside the news from the battlefield. How could it not, when he echoed the bullets of the fighters, their rockets, drones, and achievements? He delivered these triumphs to the world from the steadfast podium, standing firm against the enemy's threats, promises of vengeance, and crimes.""__**

**__""Yes, we know the cost is high, and the price is great, but victory is only an hour's patience,"" __**he said in a recent speech. 

A few weeks ago, he was giving a press conference in the Ghobeiri area of the southern suburbs of Beirut when the IOF sent a threat to bomb the area. He ended his speech, ""We will be victorious,"" and then was asked, ""Hajj Mohammed, what is your opinion about the 'israeli' threats that came during this press conference?""

**""Bombing does not scare us. So how will threats scare us? Indeed, our will is unshakeable, our determination is strong, and our resistance is steadfast.""**

Behind these walls, our women have been stripped of their freedom.
In the midst of silence and oppression, Palestinian female prisoners bear their suffering and pave the way for our freedom

From within the depths of prison, Palestinian women’s stories of strength and resilience unfold amidst their endurance of the harshest forms of torture and deprivation. 

Among them wounded women, children, and mothers deprived of their children. Palestinian prisoners endure unbearable suffering from the moment they are detained until their very last moment in prison. The suffering isn’t confined within the occupation’s prisons; on the contrary, the effects of the excruciating physical and mental torture remain with the freed prisoners long after their release.

Consistent violations of their freedoms and sanctities, as the occupation forcibly removes the prisoners’ hijabs.
Any attempt to invoke their right to refuse the removal of their hijab is met with barbarity and further forced naked searches. Occupation forces have not only confiscated Palestinian prisoners’ hijabs, but they have also confiscated any needles or threads to prevent prisoners from repairing the torn shoes and clothing that the occupation had replaced their modest attire with. Prisoners have no choice but to borrow each others’ shoes when they need them to go outside for breaks or to meet with their lawyers.

Systematic medical neglect; the necessary medical care is not provided to any of the women inside the occupation’s prisons facing diseases, injuries, and mental ailments exacerbated inside the prison.
The hardest times, reported by many imprisoned women, are during pregnancy, where they are denied all necessary medical attention and even deprived of sunlight.

Prison cells unfit for human habitation. Humidity, moldy walls, and blankets—if provided— that reek. This is how prisoners describe their rooms in which they are held.
Torture is meticulously designed into every detail possible, where, in addition to the widespread insects and pests that spread diseases and infections, the lights are turned on and off at the whim of the occupation soldiers and guards, after cutting access to control them from inside the cells. 

A Palestinian prisoner describes her arrest: “My house was raided and I was detained by special forces a week after the start of the assault on Gaza. I was taken to a police station in my residential area while being threatened with execution or “deportation to Gaza” along with insults and intimidation tactics.” She was then transferred, her hands and feet shackled, to an isolated area, where she was subjected to shabah (a form of torture) under heavy rain alongside prisoners from Gaza, in a brutal and horrifying scene.

Talking about the first hours inside Al-Damon prison, she says: “When I first entered, campaigns of repression and cell raids using batons and tear gas began, and all essential supplies that were previously available to prisoners including cooking utensils, electrical appliances, books, and more, were confiscated.” Based on what she was told by other prisoners, she added “Women are being detained in unprecedented numbers from across Palestine on a daily basis and at an increasingly rapid rate.”

She also mentioned the harsh circumstances and constant threats of rape that women from Gaza are experiencing. Many had been abducted from shelters and know nothing about their children or their whereabouts. One Palestinian prisoner from Gaza says, “I was abducted and I know nothing about my four-month-old baby, my heart is shattering with worry over him.”",165.0,0.0,0,False

He is set to be freed on **December 6th, 2024,** after recently reaching 40 years of imprisonment. His release is contingent upon him leaving France.

For four decades years, immense popular pressure has been directed on French, American, and European authorities to secure his freedom. Last summer, Georges submitted the ninth request for his release, as his minimum sentence ended in 1999. Despite this, American intervention repeatedly blocked his release. Notably, his eighth release request,** which was approved by the French judiciary in 2013**, would have seen his release, but was overturned by American pressure, absurdly arguing that that the 72-year-old man ""may return to the battlefield."" It was revealed in 2015 that Hillary Clinton ordered French FM Fabius to keep Georges imprisoned in 2015. **In fact, Georges has been eligible for release since 1999, but the state fears his capacity to galvanize the masses.**

Georges, from his humble Lebanese village of Al-Qoubaiyat, he was inspired by the revolutionary broadcasts of the PFLP, and soon formed and led the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions (LARF). When the zionist enemy invaded Lebanon in 1982, he worked tirelessly to halt the supply of weapons from Europe to the zionist entity. He was arrested in 1984 under fabricated charges—French police claimed that weapons that were never present were found. By 1987, he was convicted for the alleged murder of a US Army officer and a zionist embassy official in Paris.

Georges neither confirmed nor denied the allegations. To him, the trial was a farce. **His position was clear: the French state and its authorities are complicit in the occupation of Lebanon and Palestine.** To him, the courts were theatrics, a tool of imperialism to obfuscate the complicity of the US and France in the bombing of his country. 

In his own words:
[**__""Comrades, let us be vigilant and prevent the zionist criminals from annihilating the revolutionary heroes in captivity!""__**](https://t.me/RNN_Prisoners/1096)
**__""Let us be worthy of the epic of the torches of freedom, those invincible resistance heroes detained in zionist prisons! Naturally, the popular Palestinian masses and their fighting vanguards in captivity can count on your active solidarity. May a thousand solidarity initiatives flourish for the sake of Palestine and its glorious resistance.""__**
**__""Glory and eternity to the martyrs! Victory to the masses and the struggling peoples.""
""__**[**__Yes to building a comprehensive Arab resistance front to confront normalization in all forms!__**](https://samidoun.net/2022/01/georges-abdallahs-message-to-the-international-week-of-solidarity-to-free-ahmad-saadat/)**__""

[The act by the administration of ""Damon"" Prison](https://t.me/RNN_Prisoners/2432) of confiscating the abayas, hijabs, and niqabs of Palestinian female prisoners is a dangerous step and a continuation of the occupation’s targeting, oppression, and violations against our honorable women in prisons.

We affirm that these heinous crimes and the targeting of women in prisons violate all religious, human rights, and humanitarian values, and these practices cannot be ignored. Our people possess the will and determination to respond to the occupation and to confront all of its aggressive actions against our women and prisoners.

The dire conditions that prisoners face inside the prisons, including daily arbitrary searches and deprivation of all basic necessities such as food, medicine, clothing, and blankets, aim at deliberate moral and physical harm, as confirmed by facts and statistics.

We call on all local and international human rights and legal organizations, especially those concerned with women’s issues, to pressure the occupation and curb its arbitrary practices against them.

We urge all national factions, popular movements, and our people and the families of the prisoners to escalate supportive activities for the prisoners and to support their cause by all available means until they achieve full freedom.

He reportedly successfully smuggled goods into Palestine a dozen times prior, and his arrest was carried out in coordination with Jordanian intelligence.

**Today, we recall four other heroes in the prisons of the Jordanian regime:**
Jordanian citizens Hudhaifa Jaber, Ibrahim Jaber, and Khaled Al-Majdalawi were arrested a year and a half ago on charges of attempting to deliver weapons to the resistance in the northern West Bank, where resistance rages today.
Ahmad Ayesh, on the other hand, was arrested seven months ago for attempting to deliver advanced missile technology (Katyusha rockets) to the Palestinian resistance in the West Bank.

They have all been on trial in Jordan on charges related to ""terrorism,"" languishing in the horrific conditions of Jordanian prisons, just for exercising their just right and duty to support the resistance by any means amidst an existential genocide.
