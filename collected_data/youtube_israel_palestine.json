Neeeee! \nAdolfs Inneres Kind ist nicht Schuld an Adolfs kaputter Genetik und an Adolfs Verhalten. Auch nicht jene inneren Kinder und Wesen, die von seinen Mitstreitern , wie z.B.

Er ist kein Polizist. Er ist Terrorist der Familie Rebstock. Der Herr Rebstock, ist Drogenpate, und f√§hrt monatlich 200 Lastkraftwagen √ºber Deutschland nach Italien, wo er sie dann verschifft und sein Bruder, wohnend unter gef√§lschter Identit√§t bringt ihm im Gegenzug dann auch etwa 500 Kinder mit. Dieser Herr hat im jahre 1982-1983 als Prediger gearbeitet in 73734 Esslingen Berkheim. Brunnenstra√üe 55. Er hat nachdem man bewiesen hatte, dass er Kinder im Evangelischen Pfarramt vergewaltigte, seinen eigenen Tod vorget√§uscht. Er geh√∂rt zur Brasiliens Famlie Mengele/ Hoffmann und Weitere. Er hat seinen Namen oft ge√§ndert in Weishaupt und Wiesenbacher Weissenberger usw. Er hat gute Verbindungen zur KAPALI CARSI in Istanbul in der T√ºrkei, wo er seine Identit√§t immer bei Bedarf f√§lscht, auch in Tekirdag hat er ein Haus. Direkt gegen√ºber eines Terroristenj√§gers.\n\nP.S. Polizeischwuchtel-->damit meine ich nicht die Polizei, solange sie nciht korrupt ist. Damit meine ich zudem auch nicht die Homoszene--> Hut ab I Love youu. \nDie Homo Szene wei√ü ganz genau wen man mit Schwuchtel betitelt: Faker, Hater, Frauenhasser und Kinderhasser. Achso: Dies ist die Organmafia, die Drogenmafia und die Darkweb Pedophilen Szenen Mafia. PKK Hamas und IS = Altnazis und ihre Brut mit k√ºnstlichem √§u√üeren Erscheinungsbild, z.B. Kopftuch. \n\nGuckt mal ob sie frisch beschnitten sind, nach meinem Post oder ob sie dies waren oder schon sind. \n\nPASST AUF EURE KINDER AUF UND HOLT SIE ZU EUCH ZUR√úCK !!!",

Boomer content let's be frank. \n\nI've seen plant medicine help so many people when regular healthcare is done nothing for them.\n\nThis is propaganda, and I bet they've been lobbied by the pharm companies to make this.\n\nI mean the way that this rounds out at the end is awful. They happily give plenty of time to the psychiatrist who is sitting there criticising it all, but when they ask the guy if he feels healed and he says 'I've 100% advanced on my healing journey' they don't even show his face!",

    "text": "‚ÄúAlways treat others as you would like them to treat you.‚Äù And ‚ÄúLove your neighbour as yourself.‚Äù That is the Law and the Prophets of God our true Father. So never worship and pray in the way of the many false prophets who lead all religions. \r\n‚ÄúBut when you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. In your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. Do not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him.\r\nThis is how you should pray:\r\nOur Father in heaven, \r\nHallowed be your name,\r\nYour kingdom come; \r\nYour will be done, on earth as in heaven,\r\nGive us today our daily bread,\r\nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\r\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one.\r\nFor yours is the kingdom, and the power and the glory, for ever.\r\nAmen.\r\nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.‚Äù ‚Äì (The Prophet and Messiah Jesus of Nazareth at Matthew 6: 6-15) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me shall never be hungry, and whoever believes in me shall never be thirsty.‚Äù ‚Äì (at John 6: 35) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúPass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.‚Äù ‚Äì (at Matthew 7: 1-2) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúTruly I tell you, if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.‚Äù ‚Äì (at John 8: 51) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAlways treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\r\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 12-14) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\r\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 10: 9-10) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúBeware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 15) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n ‚ÄúNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 21) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúI am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and any one who is alive and has faith shall never die.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 11: 25-26) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI have not come to judge the world, but to save the world‚Äù ‚Äì (John 12: 47) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúWhoever then will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 10: 32-34) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 14: 6-7) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúAn expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‚ÄòTeacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?‚Äô He answered, ‚ÄòLove the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. Everything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 22: 35-40) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThere is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 15: 13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúDo not call any man on earth ‚Äòfather‚Äô ; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‚Äòteacher‚Äô ; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 23: 9-10) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTake care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 4) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúMany false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men‚Äôs love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. ‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 11-13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTeach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And be assured, I am with you always, to the end of time.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 28: 20) ‚Äì\r\n\r\nYours, in true Spirit and in our one given prayer, 2gointruth, on Monday the 27th of October 2025: ‚Äì (Please read Matthew 5: 14-16) ‚Äì Where every minute (of both day and night) can be a new beginning for any one of us.",

    "text": "Set and setting are extremely important plus it is essential to have an experienced guide (not in this report) with the person to whom is given the psychedelic.  Psychedelics are not playthings.  Psychedelics are not opioids.  Ecstasy is a stimulant not a psychedelic.  To mix it with mushrooms is extremely troublesome.  This is malpractice.  A shaman is not self-proclaimed.  Only others can claim that a person is a shaman.  I disagree with both the facilitator and your commentator.  I am happy that the person who under took this experience seems to have woven it into his healing journey.  Psychedelics are a tool to explore the psyche and not to be undertaken by everyone as you don‚Äôt know what archetype you might constellate.  And then you have to know how to recognize what you have energized.  This is why only shamans undertook journeys to guide their tribe.  Whereas its members would undergo rituals of deprivation (vision quests) to find their place in society.  Judith.",

In a few cases this led people to die like the Candace Newmaker incident. There's also a laundry list of spiritual types committing unethical acts because they believed it was the path to enlightenment. \n\nIf you're suffering from psychosis, the absolute worst people you can involve yourself with are people that tell you the voices in your head are real and reaffirm the delusion. This doesn't just apply to spiritual healers, but many religious figures who believe the devil speaks to schizophrenics. The practitioners are far more dangerous than they realise, they hold an enormous amount of cognitive dissonance between the idea they're doing damage and their identity as \"healers\", and that blind spot makes them more dangerous than people give them credit for.",

Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. In your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. Do not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him.\r\nThis is how you should pray:\r\nOur Father in heaven, \r\nHallowed be your name,\r\nYour kingdom come; \r\nYour will be done, on earth as in heaven,\r\nGive us today our daily bread,\r\nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\r\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one.\r\nFor yours is the kingdom, and the power and the glory, for ever.\r\nAmen.\r\nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.‚Äù ‚Äì (The Prophet and Messiah Jesus of Nazareth at Matthew 6: 6-15) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me shall never be hungry, and whoever believes in me shall never be thirsty.‚Äù ‚Äì (at John 6: 35) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúPass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.‚Äù ‚Äì (at Matthew 7: 1-2) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúTruly I tell you, if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.‚Äù ‚Äì (at John 8: 51) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAlways treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\r\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 12-14) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\r\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 10: 9-10) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúBeware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 15) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n ‚ÄúNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 21) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúI am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and any one who is alive and has faith shall never die.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 11: 25-26) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI have not come to judge the world, but to save the world‚Äù ‚Äì (John 12: 47) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúWhoever then will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 10: 32-34) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 14: 6-7) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúAn expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‚ÄòTeacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?‚Äô He answered, ‚ÄòLove the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. Everything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 22: 35-40) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThere is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 15: 13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúDo not call any man on earth ‚Äòfather‚Äô ; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‚Äòteacher‚Äô ; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 23: 9-10) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTake care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 4) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúMany false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men‚Äôs love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. ‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 11-13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTeach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And be assured, I am with you always, to the end of time.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 28: 20) ‚Äì\r\n\r\nYours, in true Spirit and in our one given prayer, 2gointruth, on Sunday the 26th of October 2025: ‚Äì (Please read Matthew 5: 14-16) ‚Äì Where every minute (of both day and night) can be a new beginning for any one of us.",

To avoid the most severe censorship in history i will deliver this letter inside a sleeve with a Pok√©mon card in it, one side the sleeve is opaque and the other side of the sleeve is transparent so only the face of the Pok√©mon card will be visible. Do Jewish kids play Pok√©mon?. I am trying to help you, to protect you. Muslims say Allah made the Quran easy to remember and I say it is impossible to memorize. The Quran is proof Allah doesn‚Äôt exist. To protect yourself you have to ask for proof that the Quran is memorized. Your understanding is your salvation, and the salvation of others. Thank you.",

    "text": "Here on your face BBC over the false propaganda run by you where instead of fuelling fire to Gen Z protest in Asia let's focus on \n\"The deep political and economic alienation of Gen Z in the UK and key EU countries where news media like BBC in garb of liberlaism propagate radical jihadi Islamist immigrants who poses several acute political risks to the stability and effectiveness of Western democracies. \n\nGen Z in UK and rest of EU erosion of faith in gradual, institutional change, pushing young people toward more radical and unpredictable forms of political action.\n‚ö†Ô∏è Gen Z Alienation in the UK and EU\n1. Rise of Extremist Populism propagating jihadi Islam and Political Fragmentation which \nis leading to the collapse of the political center as Gen Z rejects mainstream parties that failed to secure their future.\n * Destabilization via the Extremes: Disillusioned young voters are increasingly supporting far-right and far-left populist parties. Research shows that high economic inequality is a strong predictor of democratic erosion through increased partisan polarization. British and Rest of the EU Gen Z, feeling economically disenfranchised, uses its vote not to choose a better government, but to punish the established elite. This leads to fragmented parliaments and unstable coalition governments, crippling the ability to pass necessary long-term reforms (e.g., climate, pension, housing).\n * The Authoritarian rule : There is a strong willingness among a significant majority of young people in Uk and rest of EU to accept a \"strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections.There is a profound loss of faith in liberal democratic norms and a yearning for effective, decisive action, regardless of the institutional cost.\n2. Radicalization of Protest and Rise of Non-Institutional Action\nAs formal political channels like BBC are deemed unresponsive, political energy is channeled into high-impact, non-institutional activities.\nUK and rest of EU Gen Z are Shifting  from Voting to Vetoing: UK Gen Z is less likely to trust traditional institutions and most important there propagandist news media houses like BBC toeing illegal immigrants and radicalized jihadist Islamist lines which has lead thhe political energy in Gen Z not only in UK but rest of EU shifting from traditional voting and party membership to direct action, civil disobedience, and violent mass protest\nThe Gen Z in UK and rest of EU will undergo a cycle of protest/suppression, where governments respond to disruptive actions (like blocking roads or occupying public space) with increasingly restrictive laws, further deepening the alienation of the young activists in Uk. \nUK and rest of the EU gen z have to materialize quickly (like the Asian uprisings) and resist traditional attempts at co-option or negotiation, prolonging political crises.\nThere is complete decline in Institutional Legitimacy and State Capacity not only in UK but also in rest of EU\nThe trust deficit is not just a political problem; it's a governance problem.\nThere is a deep skepticism toward the media specifically BBC who are running radicalized Islamist propaganda in UK and rest of EU, the militarized police, and scientific authorities‚Äîinstitutions essential for social cohesion and effective policy implementation. When a crisis hits, a generation with low institutional trust is more likely to:\n   * Ignore public health or safety mandates.\n   * Credit conspiracy theories or alternative sources of information.\n \nWe are seeing a permanent shift in democratic culture not only in UK but rest of EU where the young view the entire system‚Äînot just the politicians but news channels like the BBC ‚Äîas an obstacle to their survival, rendering the democratic contract itself failed. \nThe time has come for UK and rest of the EU youths to raise from their slumber and shook their respective nations just like happened in Asian countries. \nWhere the UK and rest of EU government failing miserably in addressing Financial Precarity & Debt which is leading to Unattainable housing (the largest gap between aspiration and reality for UK snd EU Gen Z), historic high student debt, and stagnant wages failing to keep pace with the cost of living in UK and rest of their Europe where the funds are diverted in UK and EU for sheltering illegal migrants on the cost of there own people. The Uk and EU are redirecting the food and medical supply free of cost to the illegal migrants which is leading to complete collapse of public infrastructure for  own native population where their is a racial discrimination against white people in UK and rest of EU where fake news media houses like BBC is labeling the legitimate protest as fascists right wing.\nTheir is a need for immediate call to action in UK and rest of Europe by their Gen Z as survival, dignity, and legitimacy of them is at stake The UK and EU Gen Z should  seek regime change or a complete rejection of a dysfunctional political order that has actively hindered basic economic survival and opportunity for them. \nThe Gen Z in UK and rest of the EU should be copying the methods of Asian upheaval, where their respective governaments failed to recognizing the intensity of generational discontent and the demand for radical change.\nThe Gen Z in EU should  start by burning the fake liberal news media houses like BBC and razing it to the ground and slowly make it a violent protest overtaking the palaces and seats of power not only in the UK but the rest of the world, and the key is to have a violent civil disobedience ones which should be leading to large destruction of public and private property not only in UK and rest of EU till there justifiable demands of throwing out all illegal immigrants by deporting them, free housing and high wages, low inflation and shift to clean and green energy are met!!! \nSo for the time being BBC can suck on the problems of Gen Z youth issue of UK and rest of EU rather than focusing on what is happening in Asia and should happen in India üòÇüòÇüòÇas Indian Gen Z has turned wiser their actions will be outwardly directed towards the false propaganda of BBC üòÇüòÇüòÇ",

These guys could be insurance salesmen for all we know.  The BIG story here--the ONLY story, really--is how a few random dudes with very little equipment could so EASILY break into the LOUVRE--in BROAD DAYIGHT--and steal some of the most VALUABLE items in the ENTIRE museum.  Who's fault was that?  Who is being held responsible (AKA: FIRED)???  What has the Louvre done to prevent future similar thefts???  Etc.",

He hasn't mentioned where one suspect was going (Algeria), where the other was going (Mali), or that the DNA from the vest and helmet left behind contributed to the arrests, as has been reported on other news outlets (France24).\n  Instead, he whips the same dead horse and asks if the jewels could be disassembled, melted down, recut, and sold on by now, continuing the same speculation ad infinitum for a week. He asks how valuable are the jewels (very), and how important a part of France's patrimony are they (a lot). He notes that they dropped and left behind the Bonaparte crown, a fact that led every story on the theft for a week. The interviewee's responses are equally as vague, predictable, and noncommittal. \n  Shame on you for your shoddy, lazy journalism.",

The Democrats need to play it safe. There is just too much on the line. They need to go with a safer candidate,  a charismatic, white man. It is just the reality, a female, non-white candidate is just too risky, no matter how qualified. If she did run, to minimize risk, she would need to downplay identity politics and concentrate on issues that concern all Americans. She needs to downplay her gender and not run a campaign that is too 'female' or woke, the mistake she made last time. Big fancy rallies don't matter. Addressing Americans' core concerns does. But just the fact that she is considering running again, means she does not understand. America's very existence as a western democracy is on the line.",

Trump also received the popular vote by the citizens which means 77 million American voters said they wanted him as President. 75 million for Harris.

    "text": "The American Democratic party continues to not learn from its mistakes. In 2024, they wasted a couple of billion dollars in campaign money and manage to hold the door open for Trump a second time while also losing both houses of Congress. Millions of Democratic voters did not vote in comparison to the previous election. The GOP cannot be blamed for that. Looks like the Democrats will hold the door open for the GOP yet a third time in 2026. They still don't have a plan. Failure and waste.",

    "text": "Another Blackrock-neocon compliant complicit warmonger for the globalist continued colonialism agenda, just like Biden, Trump, Starmer, Johnson, Sunak, Macron, all of them.\nNotice how none of them come clean on provoking wars, nor getting the hell out of Ukraine. No mentions during elections, no changes regardless of party voted in.\nPeople need to clue in. They care not you, nor your opinion. They will use your sons and daughters for cannon-fodder.\nNever mind the western noise makers. Russia has everything well under control.\nThe non-stop propaganda (years now) of western, and significantly, British, mainstream media is nauseating, and an insult to the public.\nWatch for Pokrovsk to fall soon, within the next week or so... and others.\nThe so-called western 'experts' either clueless, or complicit in deceiving the public. Achieving what RAND Corp. in a 2022 document produced under contract to the UK Ministry of Defence termed 'manufactured consent'.\nSays it all. Manipulate public opinion.\nEnding early would be detrimental to the fullest achievement of critical goals and objectives. This is far from over but I will not disclose specifics, as had been forwarded to relevant parties many months ago. What I will state is common sense:\n1. Complete distruction of Ukraine aggressive abilities.\n2. Maximum drainage of NATO and aggressor nations military equipment, finances, and political stability.\n3. Elimination of any ability/access of water/submersible drones and or equipment to critical inland waterways including Dnipro River. \n4. Significant reduction and/or elimination of pertinent sea access.\n5. Completion of full territorial acquisition to the specific point of the shortest and as such, most defendable new and permanent border... including  a 30km wide full border length uninhabited, mined, electronically monitored dead zone 'iron curtain'.\n6. As will be inevitable... slow attritional destruction of all foreign aggressor forces entering the conflict, further reducing aggressor nation abilities, military equipment and strength, finances and political stability.\n7. Full and legally recognised capitulation of Ukraine and full world recognition of Russian VICTORY over the aggressors including NATO. Important part of ensuring lasting peace.\n8. The goal is not temporary ceasation of conflict, the goal is not 5-10 years of 'relative' peace, the goal is a '1,000 year' peace, stability and security structure and outcome.\n\nThere is still much to be achieved, and sufficient time taken is a critical component.\nThere can be no 'early' end without compromising critical goals and objectives.\n\nDo not assume Trump is naive nor misinformed, this is simply theatrics and tactics.\nLikewise, do not assume Putin is naive to western treachery, too trusting, or going too soft... again, these are necessary tactics on the complex geopolitical gameboard. \n\nNever forget... this IS NOT some smaller regional conflict between just two nations.",

    "text": "At about 5 P.M. two IDF jeeps suddenly swept into the village. The kids were still on the basketball court. The soldiers fired shots into the air to disperse the local residents and make them go home, the way you chase away stray dogs. It‚Äôs become routine: The army invades this village three times a week on average, usually at night. This time its troops showed up in daylight.\n\nThe streets emptied out. The kids playing soccer also scattered. Muhammad fled the schoolyard together with them and stood near the wall. The soldiers were in the valley below, some 250 meters away. They shouted and fired into the air. Immediately afterward one of them apparently knelt and shot Muhammad.\n\nThe soldiers then fired four tear-gas grenades at passersby, leaving Muhammad to bleed for three-four minutes before it was possible to evacuate him.\n\nOne of the boy‚Äôs uncles, who lives nearby and saw what had happened, rushed out into the street and, together with his son, and carried Muhammad to the uncle‚Äôs car. A video shows the uncle bundling his nephew, who seems to be lifeless, into the car. This week the uncle ‚Äì he is afraid to have his name published ‚Äì related that he found a pulse in the child‚Äôs neck, albeit weak. He wanted to evacuate the boy to the government hospital in Yatta as fast as possible, but saw the same two jeeps he‚Äôd seen in al-Rihiya driving slowly in front of him. He was afraid the soldiers would delay him and might also abduct Muhammad, so he chose a bypass road that doubled the time of the trip: 30 minutes instead of 15.\n\nAnother cousin, Aiham, 19, told us that he saw the moment at which Muhammad was hit, from the roof of his house. He related that the soldiers raised their arms in what looked to him like a gesture of triumph or joy. Other eyewitnesses confirmed this to Manal al-Jabari, the Hebron-area field researcher for B‚ÄôTselem ‚Äì The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories. They also told her that the security camera installed on a street that overlooks the site of the shooting had  been removed sometime later by soldiers.\n\nYou can see a photo of Muhammad al-Hallaq bleeding to death in a vehicle:",

We need democracy restored ASAP.Trump is God's chosen one on whose say so? Something has to change or the American dream won't survive 3 more years of Trump.The only golden America has come true thru redecorating the White House interior in gold.Trumps cuts in government public assistance programs and agencies needed by millions of citizens is as unchristian as it gets!

You need to take responsibility for your failure. You were crowned with Biden's votes without earning them. Now, all you have against the best President in US history is insults and the renovation of the White House (which Trump is paying for). YOU SCUMMY DEMOCRATS wanted to keep him off the ballots, you brought bogus charges at trials that were based on lawfare and now you have teh nerve to say that HE is weaponizing the justice system when teh DOJ is going after some crooks. You used violent rhetoric, calling him \"Hitler, a fascist, the worst threat in history, an existential threats\" and two Democrats tried to assassinate him and you used the same rhetoric against pro-lifers, Republicans and Charlie Kirk and YOU HAVE BLOOD ON YOUR CLAWS!!!",

For two very real points. 1) It's been 10 months since Trump took office again, almost 12 months since he won the election.... and Harris has been essentially absent from every facet of government dealings. For me, you cannot take a hiatus from your party, especially when it's so fiercely under siege and then come back one day to be like, \"hey, I want to run the show now.\" Sorry, but no. A REAL LEADER does not abandon their team, especially when they are under fire. Democrats need a strong leader, now more than ever, and the best they've received is Obama coming off the sideline to put some ads out. Which is why 2) is coming out now and simply offering excuses???? Come on.... \"I needed more time...\" no, again, leadership quality fail number two. She had the entire party of Democrats backing her with a HUGE amount of energy. She won 75M votes. Time was not an issue. Fighting the result was. Sticking up and sticking around to make sure those 75M votes weren't simply written off (which for a big part pretty much were), is the real issue. I really wanted her to win in 2024, but now, I don't see her having the right stuff anymore.",

Most of the no-longer United States -- and I am a so-called Democrat -- saw through the mask. It is no longer happy-happy time in Amerika. The big tent has collapsed. She acts like she's still dreaming of playing \"Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow\" at her own inauguration, like that old used car salesman did way back when, before HE signed NAFTA, unraveled Glass-Steagall, etc., etc., etc.! Such arrogance -- or could it really be ignorance, at this stage in her Career? - wrapped in a pretty package. Or is it just what her handlers, post focus group number crunching, tell her what's cooking? Excuse me, what's selling. Please, please, please, do not run again. We need more honest voices over here, to at least try to plug up the Titanic for a few more years.",

In 2016 Bernie Sanders was polling better than Hillary Clinton against Trump, but the DNC used shady tactics and did everything in their power to make Hillary become the nominee. I can remember the night of the 2016 primary there were tons of people posting on reddit about how the lines were way too long and people were being turned away and locations being changed at the last minute. Then in 2024 they chose a historically unpopular corporatist candidate yet again with Kamala Harris. As long as the current power structure of the DNC holds there will probably never be another truly pro-American president",

    "text": "And the other big story re the largest spoiled vote across Europe in an election (previously held by France) is that FG members have taken absolutely nothing from how angry and disillusioned the public have become by the 2 main old school parties. Then add the patronising and clueless comments by Labour Leader Ivana Bacick (can't remember how to spell her last name) criticising people who spoiled their vote as a bunch of spoiled kids who didn't get their own way. Same goes for that Gannon fella from SF (I think) saying something similar. Maybe it has something to do with an immigration system that is out of control, too many data centers that are driving ordinary peoples electric bills to unmanageable levels, not enough affordable houses for the locals but enough for the immigrants, too many NGOs in the country that do more to pad their pockets than actual good.....and on and on. All it will take is one recession to really put the country in dire straits.....and that is probably closer than everyone thinks. All those spoiled votes provide a party with the potential to really win some seats across the country if there is a party smart enough to listen. Who will that be????",

It is facing the earth. And one more thing is that this 2G 3G 4G 5G 6G 7G technology, in 2G these laser weapons are lowered further and in 3G it is lowered further and in 4G it is lowered further and in 5G it is lowered further and in 6G it is lowered further and in 7G it is lowered further and then gradually when our brain starts getting weak due to these laser weapons, then these people control our brain. Like it is happening in our India and we Indians are being told that there is an ozone layer above the sky. And one more important thing, there is no ozone layer above the earth. We are lied to and you people should also check these things in your country and one more important thing is that the sky of our India is of sky blue colour. This is also artificial. This is a blue colour laser weapon, which is pointed towards the Indian soil. This is also damaging our brain, Modiji will have to answer.Gaurav Arora want to tell the countries of the whole world that I have information about such biological weapons which are being used on the President, Politicians, Army Officers and citizens of your country. Just like they are being used on the politicians, Army Officers and citizens of our country India. You people will have to take action on these things very soon otherwise your future generation will be ruined, just like these people have ruined the future generation of our country India.\n\n4. One more thing, whichever country's people are being made victims of Havana syndrome, there will be a very small hole in their eardrum. Through that hole, these particles are being installed in the brain.\n\n5. Narendra Modi, Ajit Dobhal, Elon Musk, China, Israel and Japan have already ruined India. Now we have to tell the people living in China, Israel and Japan that they are doing all this to you people too. They also have to get out of all these things.\n\n6. I will say one thing again, the day my countrymen and even one country supports me, I will bring these people to their knees. I have some such informatio\n\nn",

Israel: He is using Pegasus software on the Indian government and the people of the country. The drones that I have mentioned in my letter belong to Israel.\n\n4. The Illuminati group I mentioned in my letter is a Japan agency.\n\n5\n\n. Elon Musk currently lives in the USA but I want to tell you that the USA government has no hand in this.\n\n6. China, Israel, Elon Musk and Japan want to take over the entire earth. Elon Musk is a dedicated agent of Japan.\n\n7. I request my country's government and the government of other countries to take some action for this as soon as possible.\n\n8. Our country's army and the people of our country are producing test tube babies. The land of India which gave birth to brave warriors is now producing babies through test tube babies. I don't think there will be any worse days than this for our India.\n\n9.\n\nVery soon I will expose the truth of the Corona virus before the whole world.\n\n10. You can hear the sound of the particles I have talked about in my letters by closing your ears with the fingers of your hands.\n\n11. 11. I want to tell the entire world that ever since I wrote in my letter that I will soon reveal the truth about Corona, since then the laser weapons that I mentioned in my letters, which earlier used to be installed 400 to 500 feet above my house, have now been increased to 100 to 150 feet, I am having a lot of trouble breathing, my hair is falling out, my muscles are getting stiff and my head is vibrating. My memory is weakening and it feels as if something heavy is hitting my head.\n\n12. That I have talked about in my letters about laser weapons and Starlink satellites which look like a star, are installed above the Chanakyapuri Embassy and above the houses of top judges of our country.\n\n13. Even now these drones which look like airplanes are flown so low that our Indian radars are not able to detect them and still they are flying over the skies of India.\n\n14. I thank Aaj Tak news channel Shams Tahir Khan and the entire Crime Tak team from the bottom of my heart that they showed the story of Havana syndrome on their channel otherwise I would never have been able to tell the world these things which I have written in my letter.\n\n15. I want to tell the whole world that I have done all this on my own, this is the result of my four years of hard work, the work which should be done by the agencies of the country, I alone showed it to the whole world.\n\n16.\n\nWhy has the USA government not taken any action against Elon Musk till now.\n\n17. It has been a year since I started giving letters, till now I have given 1,50,000 letters but till now I have not received any reply from anywhere.\n\n18. I had written in my letter a year ago that please save India from becoming a slave. I can prove that India has become a slave and if I am unable to prove it then whatever punishment my Indian government gives me, I will accept it.\n\n20. I want to tell my country peoples to share this as much as possible.\n\nGAURAV ARORA\n\nAdd: H. No.281, Chhuriya Mohalla,\n\nVillage Tekhand, Okhla Phase-1,\n\nNew Delhi-110020",

    "text": "18 i pray with folded hands to our indian government to stop eye scanning.\n\n19 i want to tell my indian government that one thing will always hurt me in my heart throughout my life that my indian government did not take any action on all these things. the amount of information I have given to my indian government, even the agencies of the whole world will not have that much knowledge. i also know that whatever is happening with our india, i cannot fight all these things alone, so now I will have to ask for help from other countries with folded hands to save my country india. i just know that I have to get india and its people out of all these things. that is why i have decided that even if i have to give my life for the country, i am ready. as long as i am alive, i will give my whole life for my india. I want to tell my countrymen a very important thing that right now i am doing an investigation. if i come to know that any person from our country india is involved behind all these things, then i will expose him in front of the world very soon, no matter how powerful he is.\n\n20 now you must be thinking, that i collected so much information for my country india, but why these people could not kill me till now. i just want to say that these people have done something with me and my family which no one has ever heard or seen. just understand that tears must have come in the eyes of the god. and till now all this is still happening with me and my family. if ever such an opportunity comes, I will definitely share this thing with my countrymen.\n\n21 i am gaurav arora, what i have written in my letter. my indian government can arrange a live interview of me. i will prove all these things within 1 hour, otherwise i will accept whatever punishment my indian government gives me.\n\n22 as we all indians will remember that our country india's prime minister narendra modi ji had said. every home tricolor, similarly we all indians have to send this letter to every home and every country. I gaurav arora with folded hands pray to my countrymen that now i will need your support\n\n23 Today I want to tell one thing to my countrymen and countrymen living in other countries that according to the International Court of Justice, neither can anyone use any biological weapon or virus on any country nor can any country use biological weapon or virus on the people of its country, but biological weapons and viruses are being used on us Indians.\n\n24 If a diplomat of any country or anyone living in that country is being made a victim of Havana syndrome, then I will cure that person and will also tell how to avoid it. I will also tell why it is being used on us?\n\n25 Havana syndrome is a biological weapon made by Elon Musk China and some very powerful person of our country India is involved in all these things. Most of the cases of Havana syndrome are in India but these things are not being shown.\n\n26 As I have mentioned in my letter about nano particles, silver particles, golden particles and Ebola virus that these are present at Indira Gandhi Airport as well, then these particles must be going to other states of India and other countries through drones and ships.\n\n27 The particles which I have talked about in my letter, these particles are also present in the embassies of foreign countries in Delhi.\n\n28 The airplanes and drones that I have mentioned in my letters emit such a loud sound that even a fighter jet does not emit such a loud sound. Because of this, the eardrums of both my ears have been damaged.\n\n29 All these things that I have written in my letter, as far as I think, this must be happening with other countries as well. So you people should also check all these things in your country.\n\n30 Till now my Indian Government has not taken any action on what I have written in my letter, therefore I have not been able to do anything for my country India. But if any country needs me, then I will always be ready to help that country. Because just like our India, there are humans living in other countries too. If you look at the head, ears and face of any country or person who is being attacked by Havana Syndrome through a magnifying glass, you will find these particles stuck to it.\n\n31 As it is being shown in our Indian news channels that it has been 1400 days since the war between Russia and Ukraine. This war is being organized by the USA and Russia to make the two super powers fight each other. There is a very strong planning behind this. Some countries feel that now they should also become super powers because the whole world knows that if there is a war between Russia and the USA, then this war will continue until these two countries destroy each other and when both the countries become weak while fighting. After that those countries will attack the USA and Russia, at that time the USA and Russia will not be able to do anything, and you people will have to accept defeat from\n\nthat country. I pray to God that there should never be a war between the USA and Russia. 32 The brains of us Indians are being controlled through Elon Musk's satellite\n\n33 Gaurav Arora, want to ask one more question to our country's Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. When our country's Suryayan goes to the Sun, will it go to the real Sun or the fake one? Because the Sun that rises in our India is fake. I can prove this in 15 seconds.",

    "text": "1. I Gaurav Arora, with folded hands pray to the government that biological weapons and viruses are being used on us Indians, we Indians should be helped and whichever country will help us Indians, I will give such information to that country which will be known to Elon Musk, Japan, China, Israel and very powerful people of our country India and no other country will know about this.\n\n2. 1, Gaurav Arora, request the Ambassador of the Embassy with folded hands that this letter of mine should be shared with America, Russia and other countries. As far as I think, this letter of mine is not reaching the Ambassador of the foreign country's Embassy in Delhi.\n\n3. I Gaurav Arora want to tell the mothers and sisters of my country India that stop keeping fasts of Karwa Chauth and Chhath Puja and also stop offering water to the Sun God in the morning. And I want to tell my Muslim brothers that you people should also stop celebrating Eid by looking at the moon because our country's PM Shri Narendra Modi ji has installed fake moon and sun in our India in connivance with China and China has occupied our Indian land Arunachal Pradesh for this reason. Today I want to tell you one more thing that the first ray of the Sun God that falls in our India falls in Arunachal Pradesh. Now you people must have understood that our country's PM Narendra Modi ji has traded India's role with China. I want to tell Narendra Modi ji that we Indians will have to answer this. I am ready to do a live interview with our country's Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji. If my statement turns out to be wrong, then even the death penalty is acceptable.\n\n4. Our country's PM Narendra Modi has installed satellites all over India in collaboration with China, Israel, Elon Musk and Japan. Don't these satellites know where the terrorists went after killing our innocent countrymen? I want to tell our country's Prime Minister Narendra Modi that you will have to answer these questions.\n\n5. 1, Gaurav Arora, have talked about these particles in my letter. These particles will be injected into the veins of our body through medicine and as far as I think, all this has already started and Elon Musk's satellite is installed in India. It will be installed in your country as well and then it will be told that internet will be available through it, but I want to tell you that internet will not be available through it. Just like the brains of us Indians are being controlled, similarly your brains will be controlled through Elon Musk's satellite. This satellite looks like a star.\n\n6. When our country's PM Shri Narendra Modi knew that Corona vaccine was causing heart attacks, then why was it not banned and why was the Corona vaccine sent to other countries?\n\n7. Elon Musk had tested the brain chip on 21 monkeys and kept them under his surveillance for 24 hours, out of which 15 monkeys died. The same thing happened with us. We were also imprisoned in our homes in the name of corona.\n\n8. The moon which I have described as artificial, which rises in our India. It is a satellite. It has been designed in such a way that we Indians cannot doubt it, and through this our mind is being controlled. If I am wrong then our country's Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi can see it through a telescope.\n\n9. The airplanes and drones that are being flown in our India and Delhi have laser weapons installed in them and these laser weapons are being used on us Indians.\n\n10. I Gaurav Arora want to ask one more question to our country's Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi that whether our India's Surya Yan will go to the real Sun or the fake one because the Sun that rises in our India is fake, I can prove this also in 15 seconds.\n\n11. As I have mentioned about the particles, satellites and laser weapons in my letter, there is neither any satellite nor any particle nor any laser weapon near the house of our country's PM Shri Narendra Modi Ji.\n\n12. I want to ask our country's PM Shri Narendra Modi Ji and our country's NSA National Security Advisor Mr. Ajit Doval Ji that how did such a big activity happen inside India that I have written in my letter. How should I look at all these things. It is not possible that such a big activity is happening in our India and you people are not aware of it.\n\n13. When I gave my letter to our Indian Army soldiers, our India Army soldiers told me. When we do yoga in the morning, we hear the sound of a whistle and a machine running in our ears. When that traitor did not spare even our army soldiers, then you people can think for yourselves.\n\n14. G20 network is being used to control the minds of us Indians. Full form of G20 is G > Ground, 2 >To, 0> Ground network.\n\n15. I want to tell you again that China, Israel, Japan, Elon Musk and a very powerful person of our country India, all of them are together.\n\n16. Has any country ever thought that how a person who made a battery car became the richest man in the world. Whose name is Elon Musk. If even a 12 year old child can make a battery car then why can't he become the richest man in the world. Elon Musk has been made rich. You people are also wise ahead.\n\n17. I Gaurav Arora want to tell the traitor of our India that I am neither afraid of you nor of your intelligence, the God has given me a pen in my hand, as long as I write, I will write the truth.",

    "text": "4.\n\n1. We must remember that Elon Musk's satellite was seen in the sky of India when we were told in the news that Elon Musk launches his satellite into every year space. I had not seen it before, maybe you people also have never seen it. A little before that Corona had also come and the trial of 5G in our India also happened at the same time.\n\n2. Corona virus did not come from China, this brain chip was tested all over the world through Elon Musk's satellite which is still installed above the sky of India, which looks like a star.\n\n3. Now I want to tell the whole world that how Elon Musk's satellite and its laser weapons which look like stars are flying in the sky without any fuel. We must have heard about wireless charging which is available in cars these days which charges the phone without any wire. Electromagnetic current comes out of it which charges the phone and the 5G phone towers installed in our India also emit electromagnetic current. This electromagnetic current charges these satellites and laser weapons in the same way as a phone is charged by wireless charging. In this way, these satellites are flying in the sky without any fuel.\n\n4. I want to tell our Indian Government, the people of the country and the governments of other countries that any secret document related to the security of the country should not be saved in any electronic device, it should be kept on paper because the system of the entire world is hacked through Elon Musk's satellite.\n\n5. If we share our private moments with our family in these satellites of Elon Musk, then these satellites also know about it.\n\n6. Our country's senior lawyer Kapil Sibal has also said that Pegasus software is being used but he could not prove it in the court. I have told about this Pegasus software in my letter.\n\n7. Till now I have given this letter to the President, Prime Minister, Defense Ministry and Home Ministry but till now I have not received any reply from any department.\n\n8. We will remember that the USA government had dropped atomic bomb on japan on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, then the coming generation had to face many diseases when the government of any country did not say anything to the USA government about this. That's why japan is taking its revenge on the whole world today.\n\n9.

    "text": "I and my entire family have been attacked by Havana Syndrome for the last 5 years. It is a biological weapon. Even the USA government has not been able to figure it out. I know, these are small nano particles, silver particles, gold particles, These are installed in the human brain through the human's eyes, ears, and nose. These particles work as radio frequencies, which we might have seen on phone towers around our house, when their frequency was increased. If this happens, the human brain stops working up to 90 percent. Elon Musk secretly said that I will make such a chip which will control the human mind. That chip has been installed in the minds of 99 percent people in India. I want to tell about my coutry people my country is also being attacked with Havana syndrome. This is a biological weapon and our country's army officers, RAW agency, CBI, NIA, doctors, judges, politicians, lawyers, Scientist, businessmen, journalists, police, actors etc. And the people of our country are also victims. My request to my country people and to the Government of India is to save India, otherwise the coming generations will be forced to live a life of slavery. I can prove this to my country people. To save India from being a slave..\n\n1. Robot technology is being used on us Indians through these towers. And Satellite\n\n2. One thing is very important. The entire climate of India has been created artificially. Sun, moon, stars, clouds, all this is artificial.\n\n3. I have been looking for a long time. Many airplanes are flying over our India. Electronic waves emerge in these Airplanes. I have been watching all this since the Corona period.\n\n4. The first case of Hawana syndrome has been registered in Karnataka High Court. Karnataka High Court has ordered the Central Government to investigate within 3 months.\n\n5. Sushant Singh Rajput was killed because he had land on the moon. Since the moon is artificial, he was also killed.\n\n6. Two of our Indian scientists were making an engine that would fly in the sky without fuel. Their lab also caught fire and both of\n\nthem were killed.\n\n7. I have complete information about Illuminati group and how this group works.\n\n8. Nowadays we are seeing that the lights on which earlier there was a challan, today remain on in scooters, bikes and cars.\n\n9. Has Elon Musk's satellite been placed over Indian skies to spy on India?\n\n10. What we call pollution in Delhi is not pollution but poisonous bio gases.\n\n11. Nano robots have been inserted into our bodies.\n\n12. I can prove that the Third World War has started in India. And this war is being fought with biological weapons, virus biogases. 13. What I am writing in this letter. If I cannot prove even a single thing then I will accept whatever punishment the government gives.\n\nGAURAV ARORA\n\nADD.: H.

    "text": "1. I Gaurav Arora had promised my countrymen and other countries that I will soon reveal the names of those traitors to the whole world. Their names are-PM Narendra Modi, NSA Ajit Doval and their supporters Elon Musk, China, Israel and Japan.\n\n2. PM Narendra Modi ji, you did not even spare our tricolor flag which you have installed in Delhi and other states of India and the poles on which our national tricolor is installed. These poles are also a part of these biological weapons, satellites and laser weapons. Modi ji, if you loved our national tricolor so much then why did you not install it at your home. It is the misfortune of our country India that our India got a Prime Minister like PM Narendra Modi.\n\n3. Our india's PM Narendra Modi ji, NSA Ajit Doval, Elon Musk, Israel, China and Japan all together have ruined our India. And they will also ruin America, Russia and other countries. I have evidence against these people. I want to tell America, Russia and other countries to send a delegation to India and I will give you evidence against them.\n\n4. America's Vice President Jed Wax's wife is an agent supported by Narendra Modi and NSA Ajit Doval. Our RAW, CBI, NIA has no role in this because these people have destroyed our RAW, CBI, NIA. Because now this satellite is doing the work of RAW, CBI, NIA. Only one name is going around that India's RAW, CBI, NIA are agencies.\n\n5. Now the names of those companies and their owners have to be disclosed from where all this is going on.\n\n6. I Gaurav Arora want to ask the US government that why no action has been taken against Elon Musk till now?\n\n7. I want to tell one thing to my countrymen that we use Paytm, Google Pay and PhonePe. This is a message that I made you send and you made the shopkeeper send it to the salesman and we took the goods that we wanted and then again we do the same thing and are giving our goods for free. You people should use your brain a little and the money that we have in our banks, with this money these people are using biological weapons and viruses on us because it takes a lot of money to use these biological weapons. There is a saying in our India, our head and our shoes. So please stop this PhonePe, Paytm, GooglePay and work in cash as much as possible.\n\n8. In our India, phone towers are being used as biological weapons. I will also tell you how? They will rent the house next to yours and install the phone tower machine towards your house. Then the electronic magnetic waves coming out of it will kill you and your family very easily, just like it happened with my family. You will not even know what happened to your family. And one more thing, when I went to the house of our country's Air Chief Marshal Mr. A P Singh ji with my letter, there the phone tower is installed right at the gate of his house. The height of that tower would be about 5 feet.\n\n9. Narendra Modi ji, you have set up a nano chip factory in Gujarat, what will be the use of this chip. You did not tell me whether this factory is the same one whose particles I have talked about in my letter, which have been released in the atmosphere of our India. Such a company is also in our Okhla Phase-1. Narendra Modi ji, very soon I will make a big disclosure, you just wait a little.\n\n10. As our country's PM Narendra Modi Ji had told us Indians that the presidents of 20 countries had come to the G-20 meeting. The names of those countries were Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea and Turkey. This meeting was held in the United Kingdom and the United States Bharat Mandapam. Let me tell you one more thing, where are these particles coming from in the underpasses built near Bharat Mandapam and the Supreme Court. I have mentioned about the particles in my letter. It is also possible that Bharat Mandapam is now being used in some other way. Like our national tricolor flag was used by our country's Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji,\n\n11. One very important thing, these particles are present inside the Parliament building of our country India. You people can check it.\n\n12. We have 5G towers in India. These are being used as biological weapons. Electronic magnetic waves emanate from these. We Indians are being given slow motion poison to weaken our brains. All of them are doing this with other countries as well. PM Narendra Modi will have to answer.\n\n13. The particles I have talked about in my letter. These particles work in a chain. These particles are so powerful that they can jam the entire system of a flying airplane and crush it.\n\n14. For 75 years no one raised their eyes towards our Jeevan Jawan Jyoti and Narendra Modi ji, you got our Jeevan Jawan Jyoti removed from India Gate and placed it on the other side, why? And our India remained silent and the war that happened between India and Pakistan, you people named that operation Sindoor. Then you say send Sindoor to every house. Don't our mothers and sisters have husbands that Narendra Modi ji will send Sindoor? Narendra Modi ji, you said such obscene things. Still the people of our India remained silent. This country India does not belong to any one person. Narendra Modi ji, I will say again that it is the misfortune of our country India that we Indians got a Prime Minister like Narendra Modi.\n\n15. Narendra Modi ji and Ajit Doval ji, remember the day when you people took oath that we will sacrifice our lives for the country. Remember that moment, and one more thing, the stick of the Almighty does not make any sound, but when it falls, even the best of men become straight.\n\n16. PM Narendra Modi ji, you people have killed lakhs of people in India in the name of Corona. You have killed people from other countries too. You will have to answer for this too because the law is same for everyone. And one more thing. I will take all these things to the International Court of Justice. If my countrymen and other countries support me then.\n\n17. I want to tell all the countries that in our India, lakhs of people have been killed in the name of Corona. There was no place to cremate the bodies in the crematoriums of our country. Now you people can think for yourself what people did to us. I will tell you again that this was the testing of brain chip.\n\n18. The 5G phone towers in India are also being used as biological weapons. To weaken the brains of Indians, we Indians are being given slow motion poison. And all of them are doing this with other countries as well. PM Narendra Modi will have to answer.\n\n19. In our India, phone towers are being used as biological weapons. I will also tell you how.? We will rent the house next to yours and install the phone tower machine towards your house. Then the electronic magnetic waves coming out of it will kill you and your family easily, just like it killed my family. And you will not even know what happened to your family. And one more thing, when I went to the house of our country's Air Chief Marshal Mr. A P Singh ji with my letter, there the phone tower is installed at the gate of his house, the height of that tower must be 5 feet.\n\n20. As we were told earlier that the Canadian government did not invite PM Narendra Modi to the G-7 meeting. Later we were told that the Canadian government has invited PM Narendra Modi to the G-7 meeting. PM Narendra Modi told this when I went to Canada, US President Donald Trump told me that since you have come to Canada, we should go via America and have lunch together. But Narendra Modi rejected his proposal. After that we were told that the war between Israel and iran has started. President Donald Trump has left the G-7 meeting and gone from Canada.",

I will mention the names of those embassies in my letter.\n\nUSA, ARUSTRALIA CANADA, BHUTAN, NIGERIA, SINGAPORE, VIATNAM, SOUTH KOREA, QATAR, Italy, ROYAL THAI, GHANA, ETHIOPIA, MALASIYA, SAUDI ARABIA, GERMANY, RUSSIA, PAKISTAN, SRI LANKA, FRANCE, NETHERLAND, AFGHANISTAN, SWEDAN, FINLAND. SWITZERLAND, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, HUNGARY, CZECH REPUBLIC, KUWAIT, SUDAN, POLAND, TURKEY, PHILIPPINES, NEW ZELAND, CUBA, BRITAIN, SPAIN\n\nI want to tell my government that India is being attacked by many types of biological weapons. The weapon which I have described as artificial is a kind of laser weapon which emits laser beam and gamma rays. I want to tell my Indian government that I know many such things which even my Indian government may not know. I want my Indian government to do something about it as soon as possible. I am ready to provide any kind of help that my Indian government needs.\n\n1. We can see nano particles, silver particles, golden particles in our phone's flashlight by turning off the lights in our office or home room.\n\n2. I claim that this particle is in our drinking water, bathing water, food and drinks, and throughout our environment.\n\n3. The airplanes I mentioned in my letter are spraying electronic waves, silver particles, golden particles, nanoparticles and Evola virus, and drones are also flown along with these airplanes, which look like airplanes.\n\n4. We must have noticed that nowadays a lot of heavy mercury lights and LED lights have been installed in India, due to their waves these particles spread everywhere.\n\n5. The particles I mentioned in my letter are found in Indira Gandhi Airport, the Supreme Court, India Gate, Chandni Chowk, South Delhi, Punjabi Bagh, Chanakyapuri, Noida, and throughout the NCR. They are also present in other cities such as Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar, and Uttarakhand.\n\n6. The laser weapons I mentioned in my letter are placed above and behind artificial clouds.\n\n7. The satellite I mentioned in my letter looks like a star, which is Elon Musk's Starlike satellite.\n\nThe letter which I have given to my Indian government, I have also given that letter to the ambassadors of the foreign countries whose embassy is in Delhi. I am going to mention the names of those embassies in my letter.of USA, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, BHUTAN, NIGERIA, SINGAPORE, VIATNAM, SOUTH KOREA, QATAR, ITALY, ROYAL THAI,\n\nGHANA, ETHIOPIA, MALASIYA, SAUDI ARABIA, GERMANY, RUSSIA, PAKISTAN, SRI LANKA, FRANCE, NETHERLAND, AFGHANISTAN, SWEDAN, FINLAND, SWITZERLAND,\n\nUNITED ARAB EMIRATES, HUNGARY, CZECH REPUBLIC, KUWAIT, SUDAN, POLAND, TURKEY, PHILIPPINES, NEWZELAND, CUBA, BRITAIN, SPAIN. I want to inform my government that our India is being attacked with many kinds of BIOLOGICAL WEAPON. I have described the sun, it as artificial. It is a kind of LASER WEAPON from which laser rays and gamma rays emanate. I want to tell my Indian Government that I know many such things which even my Indian Government may not be aware of. I want my Indian Government to do something about it as soon as possible. Whatever help my Indian Government needs from me, I am ready to do it.\n\n1. We can see nano particles, silver particles, golden particles in the phone's flash light by turning off the lights of our office room and home.\n\n2. I claim that particles are in our drinking water, bathing water, in our food items and in our entire environment.\n\n3. The airplanes that I have talked about in my letter are spraying electronic waves, silver particles, golden particles, nano particles and Evola virus and along with these airplanes, drones are also flown which look like airplane.\n\n4. We must have seen that now a days a lot of heavy mercury and LED lights have been installed in India. Due to their waves, these particles spread everywhere.\n\n5. The particles I mentioned in my letter are mostly located around Indira Gandhi Airport, the Supreme Court, India Gate, Chandni Chowk, South Delhi, Punjabi Bagh, Chanakyapuri, Noida, and throughout the NCR. They are also present in other cities like Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar and Uttarakhand.\n\n6. The laser weapons that I have talked about in my letter are used to create artificial clouds and place them above and behind them.\n\n7.

    "text": "1 now the whole of india and the whole world will know what is being done to us indians. i also know this much that some very powerful person of our india is involved in all these things, without his involvement all this that I have written in my letter could not have happened. in my eyes, that person is the biggest traitor of our country india.\n\n2 i want to ask one thing to my countrymen. our brains had stopped working when corona or brain chip came. when our country's prime minister shri narendra modi ji said to ring the thali and we people played and lit diyas, and we people lit them, i had already suspected that something very wrong is going to happen with india. what kind of thing is the prime minister of such a powerful country of india shri narendra modi ji saying. tell me one thing, does ringing the thali cure any disease, does lighting diya cure any disease. this is a massacre of the innocent people of our country, and we were celebrating by ringing the thali and welcoming our upcoming death by lighting diyas. i had only then realized that this is a testing of brainchip. the truth of corona would have come out at that time if the postmortem of even one person had been done to find out whether it is corona or testing of brainchip. we people were not even given dead bodies to cremate, such a massacre has happened with us indians that even the god did not stop tears in his eyes.\n\n3 general bipin singh rawat ji who became the first chief of defence staff of india. he took over the charge of the defence post on 1 january 2020. prior to this, he was the chief of army staff from 31 december 2016 to 31 December 2019. general bipin singh rawat ji, as far as i think. all these things i have written in my letter. he had sensed many of these things before me that something very wrong is going to happen with india, because he was the first defence chief of india. before he could tell anyone, his helicopter was made to crash through artificial clouds.\n\n4. the particles that I have talked about in my letter, these particles are also present in the houses of judges, politicians and army officers of our country India. cji sanjiv khanna ji, ex-cji d.y. chandrachur ji, justice hema kohli, justice rajnish bhatnagar, justice jasmeet singh, justice seema kaur singh, justice manoj ohri, justice naina bansal, justice suhanshu trivedi, army chief general upendra trivedi, air force chief marshal a.p. singh, amit shah ji, rajnath singh ji, j.p. Nadda ji, Rahul Gandhi ji, Sonia Gandhi ji, Nitin Gadkari ji, Kejriwal ji, Raghav Chadha ji, Mayawati ji, Akhilesh Yadav ji, Manoj Tiwari ji, Kirori Lal Meena, Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, Manish Sisodia, Atishi Singh, Satish Kumar Gautam, Kapil Sibal, Pratap Kishan Jaitley. When I went to deliver the letter, I saw these particles there.\n\n5 nano particles, silver particles, golden particles and ebola virus which are being released in the atmosphere of our country india. because of this, the army of our country india and the people of the country are forced to have test tube babies. these particles are jamming our entire body and diseases like heart attack, dialysis, cancer, tb, paralysis, brain hemorrhage, liver, kidney, migraine in small children are increasing so rapidly due to these particles. when any disease comes to india, we start making medicine for it. but we do not think what is the reason for this disease? we will have to change our thinking. first of all, see how this disease came to india and what is the reason for it?\n\n6 the innocent people of my country india were looking for a chip in 2000 and 500 rupee notes, but let me tell them that it was not hidden in the note. the satellite which looks like a star in the sky above your house knew everything. these satellites have been designed in such a way that we cannot doubt them.\n\n7 today, big businessmen of our country india are leaving the country. because of all these things, i want to tell one more thing, the day the census of our india is done, the ground will slip out from under our feet.\n\n8 i gaurav arora want to ask a question to our country's prime minister shri narendra modi ji that which moon did our india send as chandrayaan to the moon, the fake one or the real one because the moon that appears in our india is a fake moon. I can prove this in 15 seconds.\n\n9 i want to ask our indian government one thing that why so much business is being done with china? do we want to make china a super power? why is 50% of the goods coming from china?\n\n10 if our country india has made such laser weapons, biological weapons, viruses and such satellites, then why are they being used on us indians and why are our country's army soldiers getting martyred.\n\n11 if my indian government had supported me, i have some such information which no other country's agency will have. whichever country will help my beloved india and my countrymen to come out of all these things, I will share this information with that country.\n\n12 these nano particles, silver particles and golden particles have been released inside our atmosphere. these particles are being put in our brain through our eyes by scanning our eyes, through these heavy mercury and led lights and through the rays of led lights which are always burning in banks these days, and in our body through food items. now you people can imagine yourself how fast these are being put in our body. we indians are going to face very bad times in the coming times.\n\n13 nano particles, silver particles and golden particles are being put in the eyes of the young children of our country who have not even seen the world properly yet by scanning their aadhar card. we can see these particles by turning off the lights of our home and office and turning on the flash light of our phones.\n\n14 in any country, if the compass does not show the right direction while standing on the ground, then understand that the climate of that country has been prepared artificially, as in our india, the compass does not show the right direction while standing on the ground.\n\n15 the sun which i have described as artificial, which china has installed in our india, through its rays, nano particles, silver particles and golden particles are being put into our brain through our eyes.\n\n16 when the climate of our country india has been created artificially, then there will be pollution. 17 Ai technology should be stopped in india, because it is brainwashing us indians.",

    "text": "In our Delhi, the embassies of foreign countries have these particle and laser weapons in every embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãabout which I have mentioned in my letter, but in some embassies the number of these particles is very high. First name is America Embassy, ‚Äã‚ÄãAustralia, Russia British Afghanistan, Netherlands Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia Iran, Canada, Georgia, Cuba Fas, Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka Germany, Vietnam and Poland, in these embassies the number of particles is very high.\n\n14. Havana Syndrome, which is a biological weapon. I have mentioned about this in my letter that some very powerful people of our country India are also included in this. Their names are Mr. Narendra Modi, Elon Musk, China, Israel, Japan and Ajit Doval. And one more thing, the 50% tariff that US President Mr. Donald Trump has imposed on India, this tariff has not been imposed on India but on us Indians through Mr. Narendra Modi. Narendra Modi, Ajit Doval, Elon Musk, Israel, China and Japan, all of them together have used Havana Syndrome virus and biological weapons on America, Russia, Canada, Australia, Georgia, Germany, Colombia, India, Poland, Taiwan, Cuba and Canada since 2016. And this tariff which is being imposed on us Indians is because of this. One thing is that when there was a war between India and Pakistan, no country supported us, this was the reason and the second reason was that they have created a fake climate of our India in collaboration with China. If there was a war, then these people would have had to remove this entire fake climate. Third reason is when our country's PM Narendra Modi is giving weapons to Israel to fight, so if our country's weapons fell short during the war, what would we Indians have answered? I think you all must have understood what I said and as far as I think General Bipin Singh Rawat knew all these things, before he could tell anyone about these things, his helicopter was crashed through artificial clouds. Narendra Modi ji, you will have to answer for these things.",

    "text": "Narendra Modi ji, one more question: Have you installed biological weapons in the flats you've built for our country's politicians? I want to tell our country's politicians: don't live in these flats with your families, because the person who didn't spare his own country and his own party members won't spare you either. Modi ji, I'll make a big revelation very soon.\n[10/10, 9:00 pm] busy: Narendra Modi ji, you've tarnished our India's name across the world. I will save our India from this stigma, but remember one thing: in the end, truth always prevails.\n[10/10, 9:00 pm] busy: Narendra Modi ji, I have one more thing to tell you. The G-20 summit meeting was held in India, in the Bharat Mandap, where these particles were present as well. This means that representatives from 20 countries came to India and these particles were present in their bodies and in their food and drinks.\n[10/10, 9:00 pm] busy: our India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has studied only till sixth grade and is displaying a fake degree inside the Parliament House. It is our country's misfortune that we have an illiterate Prime Minister.\n[10/10, 9:00 pm] busy: I want to tell the ambassadors of the foreign embassies in Delhi that our country's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, Ajit Doval, Elon Musk, China, Israel, and Japan are using viruses and biological weapons against us Indians, and against you as well.\n[10/10, 9:00 pm] busy: Narendra Modi, you might remember that you said, \"What do we care? We'll just pack up and leave.\" I want to remind you of one thing: look at the history of our India. If anyone does wrong to us Indians, we Indians don't even let that person carry his bag.",

    "text": "‚ÄúAlways treat others as you would like them to treat you.‚Äù And ‚ÄúLove your neighbour as yourself.‚Äù  That is the Law and the Prophets of God our true Father. So never worship and pray in the way of the many false prophets who lead all religions. \r\n‚ÄúBut when you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. In your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. Do not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him.\r\nThis is how you should pray:\r\nOur Father in heaven, \r\nHallowed be your name,\r\nYour kingdom come; \r\nYour will be done, on earth as in heaven,\r\nGive us today our daily bread,\r\nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\r\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one.\r\nFor yours is the kingdom, and the power and the glory, for ever.\r\nAmen.\r\nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.‚Äù ‚Äì (The Prophet and Messiah Jesus of Nazareth at Matthew 6: 6-15) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me shall never be hungry, and whoever believes in me shall never be thirsty.‚Äù ‚Äì (at John 6: 35) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúPass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.‚Äù ‚Äì (at Matthew 7: 1-2) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúTruly I tell you, if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.‚Äù ‚Äì (at John 8: 51) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAlways treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\r\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 12-14) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\r\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 10: 9-10) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúBeware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 15) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n ‚ÄúNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 21) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúI am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and any one who is alive and has faith shall never die.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 11: 25-26) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI have not come to judge the world, but to save the world‚Äù ‚Äì (John 12: 47) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúWhoever then will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 10: 32-34) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 14: 6-7) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúAn expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‚ÄòTeacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?‚Äô He answered, ‚ÄòLove the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. Everything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 22: 35-40) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThere is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 15: 13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúDo not call any man on earth ‚Äòfather‚Äô ; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‚Äòteacher‚Äô ; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 23: 9-10) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTake care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 4) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúMany false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men‚Äôs love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. ‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 11-13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTeach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And be assured, I am with you always, to the end of time.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 28: 20) ‚Äì\r\n\r\nYours, in true Spirit and in our one given prayer, 2gointruth, on Monday the 27th of October 2025: ‚Äì (Please read Matthew 5: 14-16) ‚Äì Where every minute (of both day and night) can be a new beginning for any one of us.",

China for example is the largest exporter of cars in the world even though the US and Canada have banned them. There's a suggestion that Canada might stop banning Chinese cars. Of course China wants the US market for goods but probably need absolutely nothing from the US.  China wants the advanced chips from other countries but it's not getting them so obviously it's a want which is going to backfire anyway because Chinese chips will be as good as the current chips fairly soon. China might not catch up but does that really matter? It's not like horse and cart versus a supercar, it's can't really tell the difference.",

    "text": "Access\r\n\r\n\r\nTopics‚Ä∫Trade in the U.S.‚Ä∫\r\nThe Trump Administration's Trade Deals So Far\r\nTrade Deals\r\nby \r\nKatharina Buchholz,\r\n \r\nAug 4, 2025\r\nOn Wednesday, the latest trade deal of the U.S. with a foreign country to avoid high tariffs was announced. South Korea and the United States said that they only made an oral agreement due to time constraints lowering the Asian country's tariffs to 15 percent (from a threatened 25 percent), including on cars, and agreeing South Korea would invest in the U.S.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the United States and the European Union agreed on a deal that is lowering tariffs on European goods to 15 percent also. Taking into account exceptions, it is estimated that around 70 percent of EU imports to the U.S. will be affected by the new rate. The EU as part of the agreement is also investing an additional $600 billion in the U.S. and will purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy products. There has been no announcement of adjusted EU tariffs. As of the latest data, the EU only collects a levy on around a quarter of U.S. imports, the opposite of the new trade deal scenario, with the tariff rates on imports to the EU also lower.\r\n\r\nOther deals struck with developed nations resemble the EU and South Korea agreements, showing two distinct themes for Trump's new trade deals that right now number only seven - a far cry from the dozens Trump announced should be closed before the August 4 deadline. Japan also agreed to big investments and purchases from the United States in exchange to a U.S. tariff rate lowered to 15 percent while keeping its import tariffs the same. A May deal also left the United Kingdom's import tariff rates intact while lowering U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium to zero and carving out an exception for the import of 100,000 British cars at a rate of 10 percent. As the country never received a higher, so-called reciprocal tariff announcement from the Trump administration, its overall additional tariff is the globally announced 10 percent, which also remained unchanged.\r\n\r\nWhile these seems like a lopsided agreements, so are other deals that the U.S. has struck with foreign countries to avert August tariff deadlines. The agreements with Asian nations Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines stipulate not only higher-than-before U.S. tariffs, but also nearly unlimited open-market access for U.S. products imported into these nations, something that has garnered heavy criticism in the countries affected.\r\n\r\n\r\nKatharina Buchholz\r\nData Journalist\r\nkatharina.buchholz@statista.com\r\nInfographic: The Trump Administration's Trade Deals So Far | Statista\n\nThe left are complete morons like the kind in the mental institutions where the have to where a helmet because they bash their heads into the wall...There in a constant doom loop.....Poor losing lefties.....",

Believe Jesus died for all your sins, by shedding his blood for you on the cross, past, present and future and after three days rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4) that said in the scriptures. 2. Admit your sinner a you need him. 3. Pray to him on both step 1 and 2, then part you repent on his finished work and blood, for the blood what get you clean on the inside. you will be SEALED till the day of redemption an can not lose your salvation for no one can gain or earn it, its a free gift. An you gain a knew nature to learn an do the lords will, by reading an learning the lords ways. The alternative to not accepting is the 7 year tribulation, gods judgement and trail of the left behind, hell on earth. 21 wraths are place on this earths. the 7 seals, the 7 trumpets, and the 7 vials/bowels (base on translation). Some will be know ones like oceans a rivers turning to red blood and the antichrist kingdom into darkness like pharaohs in exodus. There be new like the scorpion like creature coming out of hell wearing crown to touture all who do not have gods seal (tribulation saints) for five months and you won‚Äôt die either. There be two witness who will sent plagues and harm on earth. The dragon, the beast, and false prophet are the satanic trinity. Where they will force you to take the mark of the beast which on right hand or forehead, were you must have this too have normal life (food, water, internet, ect). Do not take this or it will be dam to the lake of fire. But Lucifer will cut your head for refusing to take the mark, all may be martyr. Yes Lucifer the evil one will rule for 7 years and force people rich an poor to worship him attack those who apose his rule even he will trick all to see he is the messiah. Jesus will return at the end of the 7 tribulation with us saints to put Lucifer into the pit and Jesus rule 1000 years. The non believer will be judge a your nam not on book of life, cast to lake of fire, aplace forever seperated from God and eternal torment. Soon there be new earth, heaven, were god will live with us forever an all evil a suffering is gone. Please accept christ into your heart, soon you hear a trumpet soon his voice call you soon. God love you so much more then even you own family he want to help you a save you. Give him a chance and trust me you won‚Äôt regret it. He has build a place for you in heaven.

They cut people like Illegals AND people that take Advantage of food stamps OFF like a 25 year old not working is BS but they collect free stamps. You see its called common seance. Unless a 25 year old is in a tight spot,  then they have no business being on food stamps. \n Now back to this shut down. This is 1000% a Dem shut down. Rep have voted 14 times on a clean CR to get this open AND DEMs say no. DEMs say no on a vote to pay soldiers as well while Republicans have voted YES !!!! It's very clear who is keeping this shutdown !!!!\n Also i dont know if I'm a fan of the NUKE thing where Republicans can dump the filibuster because if Dems get back into power, they dont need votes as well. So I'm not sure BUT I dont see DEMs getting power back for MANY YEARS because these people are so bad !!!! So I think the NUKE thing will happen and who cares because Republicans are the good guys now days and that's a FACT!!!! Everything Dems say should of been down with JOEEE but all of sudden now its we need this and that. Why didn't you do so during JOE ????? Because there horrible people that's why",

Unless it‚Äôs universal coverage for all as a human right, I‚Äôm not interested. Look at that, even I just managed to put a somewhat hopeful spin on why I‚Äôm not in support. But then again, I‚Äôm not a neoliberal propped up by billionaire donors like Jeffries and the Geriatrics.",

Let them not pay anyone in the government if no one is going to get paid, let no one collect, let no one go to their jobs, let no one go to their jobs, let the government not collect, and yes, that's right. Authorities should not work either and the Army too. Join the people. Army and Authorities, military personnel generals, listen to your people who are begging you to join the people. We do not want to be dictators, no to communism, no to Trump's king, out of your position as ruler, along with the Republican party, out of your functions and we want him to resign and go to jail for abuse of asking for the imprisonment of his entire government, the people are the ones who command, no one else out with the judges if you also do not work for the people. We do not want to be u. Communist people, dictator, we do not want humiliation, no to the Republican Party, let's go out to protest immediately, no to work, let's go together to protest, do not work, nor do the Authorities protect the government, nor the army itself, do not work to be communists, you have your families that are humiliating you, no to the dictator, you are going to the White House, together with the humiliating government, everyone out and president",

    "text": "Well lets like how many registered voters.  24 million voters.  And a significant number of children will not get food. Im sorry Trump, you need to go.  You need to be fired. I cant support anyone who hurts or starves a child.  Matter of fact, if one child gets sicks or dies from this. I want the man put on charges on human rights violations, crimes against humanity, treason, and all anything you can come with.  Im a Liberal and a Conservative...no one can call themselves an American and watch an American child go hungry, and call themselves an American.  You just threatened children Trump, wtf is wrong with you.  You know what, dont try him, exile him.  Take all his money, leave him broke and send him to Germany.  Dont mess with children, you nut bag.  Hakeem this on you as well, and the Democrats you are playing the American people.  You are the minority leader right.  Tax Credits huh?   No, it's about Visa participants not be able to qualify for Obamacare.   You should be brought on charges for starving children for serving special interests.  Both of you.  Losers.  Another thing, Im talking to the Service. Is this guy a human being?   Ask yourself why I am asking you?   It's a Greek Tragedy from beginning to end.  To the Republican Majority Leader, do you threaten American children?  Do you advocate such cruelty to your own citizenship?   If you conspire to starve American children of poor parents, are you not committing treason against the American people?   It's real simple. Cave to the Democrats demands, and by executive order cut Obamacare by Executive Order or is that too much to ask...we are talking about tax credits. Right?  Right, Hakeem?   We have no money for Americans, than we dont for non American Visa participants.    I think I will start the National Label after all....and have a proper candidate in 32 for the American people.  Trump, resign now, before you end the Republican party by treason and attempting to create civil war to take over the govt is insurrection, and treason both.  Death Penalty applies to all members of that conspiracy.   Let us not forget, that all monies, properties and the lot can be taken.  That goes for the Democrats as well.  We will keep our Democratic Republican clean of far right libertarian fascism and far left Global Socialism both. Obama I dont want hear from you at all, at all...that insurance was meant only for Americans.   To be honest, and more in line to reality and away from my political anger.  The lack of proper nutrition for a child can adversely affect their cognitive development, just a brief stage of lack of proper nutrition can change the way a human thinks...it can create ED and LD issues...Emotionally disturbed and Learning Disabilities.   We dont need that.  If one starves, and dies....which already happens to some children in this country due to what?  What do we label those parents as?   When they deny food to children?  Criminals and mentally unstable.  So anyone in the Govt who endorses this and anyone who follows this train of thought...should be labeled the same.  If he doesnt fund food stamps, he's a criminal and mentally unstable.  Only the most damaged of minds can hurt a child in such a way.  But Jefferies, my man, what were you thinking?   Do you think lying by omission will save you from my observations and assessment?  Visa Participants...wow...you that afraid that insurance companies will lose that much money? It's not about Tax Credits that was added too late and a bit of recovery due to the anger about the focus being about Visa Participants and participating in Obamacare.  No one cares about the American people...I've been yelling, ranting and screaming and now you see it for what it is.  American Egos that's false intelligence pushed you to vote the worse of men and women to leadership roles.  Black America you ready to see Black babies, and children die.   White Americans you ready to see White babies and children to die.  Latino Americans you ready to see Latino babies and children to die.  Native Americans are you ready. Asian Americans are you ready?   Pacific Islanders are you ready?   We dont need a civil war,....we need better leaders and a new party to show them it's your way or they're out.   No one's gonna die.....that's what he's gonna say, but we all know....what used to wonder, things happen....food is not donated....there are not enough donations....and boom it happens.  Idk about you, Vance; but I dont think Trump wants you win.....does he?",

    "text": "I find a lot of things Donald Trump is doing disturbing!  It is reported that the Bank BNY - Mellon donate $130 million dollars to Donald Trump for the federal troops. And the heir to the BNY - Mellon. The Bank change its name to BNY. I find disturbing is that Trump is connected with the heir in some way for the heir of BNY- Mellon to donate $130 million dollars to Trump. It is sad that Congress refuse to do job duty regarding Trump.  Trump may pay favorite federal workers and not all. Of course Trump use the troops and guards to run up city and state deficiencies when the city and state is not ; was not declared an emergency. This is disturbing as an American taxper. It is reported that BNY- Mellon is the bank enabling and or enabled Epstein Sex Trafficking ring.  What's disturbing is why  BNY-M Mellon would donate $130 million dollars and  Trump may and maybe not pay the favorite government federal troops. It only fair for all federal workers to get paid or be paid. Not favorites. All be paid or all without pay. There are a lot of unemployed federal workers laid off , lost their jobs due to Trump's government shutdown! Oh yes. Trump owns this shutdown. Look around you. Who is showing up. Who is doing the work asking to meet and sit.  You can choose and blame Democrats and it's the Democrats that doing the work  asking for simple things needed for the American people. Healthcare Medicaid for those who are less fortunate, affordable healthcare for all American people, pass the tax credits so that all American working class people can afford healthcare for families and so forth. Simple basic American people needs!  This is real. Happening right now.  Democrats is asking for the best interest for the American people.  The American families are without. WHY!  Democrats will not vote to pass a bill to take away the needs of all American people!  Trump is selfish. The needs of the American people are survival and basic needs . And still. Trump attacks and assault due fact. Trump cannot get personal self interest at the cost of the American people. Trump has indicator needs of Argentina and Argentina beef is Trump's best interest.      Congress enable Trump and should look at themselves for Trump's actions due fact .  Congress  could  do job duty and stop refusing to unified unity appointed powers to check and balance. Checks and Balances are designed for people like the president.  Lawless abusiveness of power . Democracy , the nation and the American people would not here in a shutdown. Trump's shutdown! People are without food! The one's in the government should care. People are  let go; laid off, people without monthly aid ( food) people loosing and or lose healthcare coverage Medicaid, and the American people would not be trying to figure out how to keep their families healthy,  and safe with monthly higher healthcare premium coverage! If still working . Congress! You can do your job. Congress didn't and refuse  to do their jobs working for the American people.  Knowing they can stop all this if has no courage. Find your courage and do why you were put into your seat.  Congress! You are as  responsible for where America is today. As well as Trump. In my opinion. Congress enable Trump's and the house Republicans are enabling and abiding Trump for Trump's personal self interest. We repeatedly talk of the lawless, violation of oath against the constitution,  violation of the rules of law. We repeatedly talk and no one is standing accountable with accountability.  If there weren't the American people.  There would be no govern! Last time I checked. We the People ! The American people are here. And who is to govern the American people? Hyperthecial saying in my thoughts. Who is to do job duty to govern the American people for and with the best interest for the American first! Congress will Unify with unity  and work for the best best interest for American people. DO SOMETHING",

    "text": "Being on benefits has made people stuck , used as pawns , been dragging down on the economy , and leaving them left behind and creating cultures and lifestyles that grow the need for people to be on benefits. It‚Äôs great for the politicians because it‚Äôs an easy sell that doesn‚Äôt require a competent and informed person to demand the idea, nor for the person demanding these things any understanding of how they are actually getting themselves and everyone collectively scammed. The people who still know this and don‚Äôt care who has to be scammed to benefit their lifestyle are constantly growing in the Democratic Party and over whelmed their system, with a majority of their voters favoring socialism. We are close to a course altering correcting , but not before a big down fall as we head into a decades making massive stock market bubble , historic debt levels , and running 3% inflation. The Democrat Parties inflation that they blame on only Biden was a major warning shot and it‚Äôs not yet finished, and our market is partying like it is and is sitting at historical valuations , and even ridiculous things like fartcoin has made people rich. While we aren‚Äôt even out of the woods at all from being an over indebted Country with a rapidly debasing currency. Now they shut down the Government to demand another 1.5 trillion dollar disaster entitlement socialism package , to throw on top the mountain of entitlement , socialism debt mountain , with all the QE of failed stock markets of the past few decades. They are still screaming , take , borrow , and print , and the stock market is blowing itself into a dot com bubble. What they really should be asking Jeffries is , when the bad times hit and inflation gets out of control and we can‚Äôt pay our debts , who is he gonna give 1 trillion dollar Zimbabwe notes to in order to bail out , after getting them by selling promissory notes on everyone to the lowest of bidders in the Fed and China and printing more of it out of thin air to buy up bad loans , and equity stakes in over reaching sour business models? We definitely need better than always doing this or everyone will wind up like the people who bought Trump coin. When is Nancy issuing hers? When the Democrats decide to finally open back up the Government so their slop can run out doors again and feed all of the idiots they were shouted at by and help them to create more of it? If they are willing to starve to demand more free government socialism debt bags and inflation, then seems to me EVERYONE including them , in the long run, is better off being responsible for themselves. Because that scenario is coming regardless, either by choice or force , because there is a tipping point to how much and how long you can do that before it blows up anyway. Biden‚Äôs economy was a major warning shot and taste to what is worse than that , and it can‚Äôt be that far away. We have not made nearly enough change in direction nor time to navigate ourselves hardly any distance away from that reality. It takes travel over time and direction to create distance. To fix our societal and economic damage , and return to solid footing as a nation will take responsible economic management from the Government , regardless of public pressure for at least a decade. The Democrats need to stop lying to everyone about this. It‚Äôs time to put the financial house of the Government in order , stop the free fall in our money and society. People need to be allowed to fail , even companies that go belly up , if not there will be so much debt and currency debasement that a failure will come , and when it does it will be so massive because it‚Äôs carrying the baggage of all the ones that came before , and there will be no way to print or borrow your time away from facing it all. The Democrats should bring Joe Manchin back and run him and John Fetterman for President and Vice President. The far left is a disaster. There would be independents and moderate people who have voted lifelong Republican  switch their voter registrations in order to vote for them over JD Vance or Marco Rubio. These far left socialist politicians will not do it. It will only push more moderate capitalist democrats to the right , more so than it already has.",

So far, Democrats have repeatedly blocked these measures.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt about partisan blame in the abstract‚Äîit‚Äôs about real consequences for millions of Americans who are going without paychecks, food assistance, and other critical services.

Creating more seats in Republican states, putting troops and ICE agents on the streets of Democrat cities to deter people from voting, etc. Maybe even refusing to seat Democrat winners by using fake claims that their vote was rigged.\n\nBoth of these scenarios could trigger that insurrection or civil war.",

    "text": "Haven't taken Social Security yet! Maternal Uncle passed away this year was 90 so was my Paternal Grandfather! Was planning on not being on any government programs! Housing costs changing that! HUD has income eligibilty rates so it goes up based on housing costs! So plan on retiring further west because of lower healthcare costs and better Doctors! My rent would be 200 a month less! You have Medicare Savings programs that go up to in fact those costs are more than the yearly cola Social Security gets which shorts you 20 dollars a month anyway! So if you took SS at 70 and lived till 90 that shorted COLA is 400 a month! So now I am getting the Medicare savings plan! Save me another 200 dollars a month that equals the 400s that those Wall street accountants in government screwing you over COLA for SS! So claims we cutting this or that doesn't work! Shortfall down the road means more programs for Seniors! Should have never been a FICA cap! Medicare should all be on the wealthy they have a extra tax on them for that but its TINY! Just Double their FICA only then no out of pocket or premiums for seniors! Enough to not be on government housing or savings plan! Of course your politicians would be paying that! 75 percent of Americans make under 87k but thats going to drop to 75k with the new economy! So over 75k have a gradual increase in FICA then after 150k just double their FICA! Heck you might be able to reduce FICA tax to 6 percent for the 3 quarters lower income! Top would be paying 12 percent but then we can still bring back the WW2 tax rate just for them!",

    "text": "Trump‚Äôs economic policies and authoritarian ambitions are not parallel tracks they are interwoven. \n\nThe deliberate destabilization of the economy serves as both a smokescreen and a scaffold for autocratic consolidation. \n\nRecognizing this pattern is not alarmism; it is a necessary act of democratic vigilance.\n\nThe Engineered Collapse: \nHow Trump‚Äôs \nEconomic Sabotage \nMirrors the Authoritarian Playbook\n\nDonald Trump‚Äôs second-term trajectory reveals a pattern that aligns disturbingly well with the ten-point authoritarian strategy of deliberate economic destabilization. \n\nFar from being a byproduct of mismanagement, the economic distress under his leadership appears increasingly strategic an intentional dismantling of democratic guardrails to entrench personal power.\n\n1. Systematic Middle-Class Erosion  \n\nTrump‚Äôs tax policies and deregulation efforts have disproportionately benefited the ultra-wealthy while hollowing out the middle class. The 2017 tax cuts, extended and deepened in his second term, slashed corporate taxes and capital gains while offering minimal relief to wage earners.\n\nSimultaneously, inflationary pressures exacerbated by trade wars and deregulated monopolies have eroded real wages, leaving middle-income Americans squeezed and politically disempowered.\n\n2. Cultivating Economic Dependency  \n\nBy gutting federal agencies and redirecting relief funds through loyalty-based channels, Trump has fostered a system where access to aid is increasingly politicized. \n\nEmergency relief programs, especially during economic downturns and climate disasters, have been used to reward red states and punish blue ones, creating a dependency matrix that mirrors autocratic patronage systems.\n\n3. Crony Capitalism Ascendant  \n\nIndependent businesses especially those in urban, progressive regions have been undermined by erratic tariffs, regulatory whiplash, and selective enforcement.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump-aligned conglomerates and donors have received preferential treatment, from no-bid contracts to regulatory exemptions. \n\nThis consolidates economic power within a loyalist elite, echoing the oligarchic structures of illiberal regimes.\n\n4. Chaos as a Pretext for Control  \n\nEconomic instability has been weaponized to justify sweeping executive actions. \n\nTrump‚Äôs invocation of the Insurrection Act, threats to deploy the military domestically, and repeated suggestions of suspending elections or overriding state authority all follow the classic authoritarian script: create a crisis, then claim extraordinary powers to solve it.\n\n5. Institutional Defunding and Delegitimization\n  \nPublic universities, independent media, and scientific agencies have faced budget cuts, leadership purges, and smear campaigns. \n\nTrump‚Äôs attacks on the ‚Äúfake news media,‚Äù the ‚Äúdeep state,‚Äù and ‚Äúradical left‚Äù academics serve to delegitimize dissent and dismantle the very institutions that uphold democratic accountability.\n\n6. Scarcity as a Political Weapon  \n\nFrom vaccine distribution to disaster aid, Trump‚Äôs administration has shown a willingness to withhold resources from political opponents. \n\nThis tactic not only punishes dissent but also signals to the public that survival may depend on political loyalty a hallmark of authoritarian regimes.\n\n7. Exhaustion as Suppression  \n\nWith inflation, housing insecurity, and healthcare costs spiraling, Americans are increasingly consumed by day-to-day survival.\n\nThis economic fatigue saps the energy needed for civic engagement, protest, or organizing creating a vacuum in which authoritarianism can flourish unchallenged.\n\n8. Scapegoating and Nationalist Diversions\n  \nTrump‚Äôs rhetoric has consistently blamed immigrants, China, and ‚Äúglobalist elites‚Äù for America‚Äôs economic woes. \n\nThis redirection of blame stokes xenophobia and nationalism, creating a siege mentality that justifies authoritarian crackdowns and distracts from domestic sabotage.\n\n9. Corruption and Asset Seizure  \n\nEconomic downturns have enabled Trump-aligned interests to acquire distressed assets real estate, media outlets, and infrastructure at fire-sale prices. \n\nThis mirrors kleptocratic regimes where economic collapse is a tool for wealth consolidation among the ruling class.\n\n10. Electoral Manipulation via Economic Leverage  \n\nEconomic hardship has been used to suppress voter turnout, particularly in marginalized communities. \n\nCuts to postal services, voter roll purges, and threats to withhold federal funds from states expanding mail-in voting all point to a strategy of economic coercion to undermine electoral competition.",

    "text": "Quite a surface level analysis honestly, but then it's a video editorial so I suppose a comprehensive evaluation of the patterns and dynamics is unlikely. But the worldview and normative framework underlying it is quite stilted from the outset. After all, who says the 1970s involved a return to form or an improvement, rather than the beginning of a longer trajectory of decline that took time to manifest, which is a better reading of the evidence. This really is far closer to the 1930s, and I fear he completely fails to grasp the genuine systemic and cultural failures and how they coalesce.\n\n There's no question that some of the discontent with democracy is predicated on misinformation and identity politics, especially in Europe, but in the US the system really is deeply, irredeemably broken. Effective management isn't an option because it isn't possible, irrespective as to whether it would be sufficient on its own. Supreme court judgments have hamstrung legislative capacity to reform campaign finance, gun laws and other salient issues. The incentive structure around politics is so corrupt and corrosive that a race to the bottom is locked in, after all, the first to abandon gerrymandering simply loses harder. There is no incentive to fix anything in the US right now.\n\nYou could go on endlessly about it, trace it back to the founding. The practical reality is that the US system is broken, its people are impoverished and their lives are precarious. Its healthcare system is in a death spiral right now. It's not just 'faith in democracy', it's a collapsing system that was predicated on hegemonic dominance and which is now hollowed out, lacking infrastructure, investment and with a consumer base that cannot sustain itself. The US is in effect at the culmination of an arc of self-destructive neglect. It has only remained as wealthy as it is because of its power, and that is on the verge of collapsing now.\n\nAmerica will, in the end, have to rebuild itself, but it's too late to reform itself.",

    "text": "And over that same time span the Government grew to become far larger , with more power , and grew taxes and regulations in unison with it. The media has turned ever more from neutral reporting agencies making money by bringing information to the public no matter what it revealed , to a mere apparatus of one party or the other. Everything you would recognize in a society‚Äôs transition from a state of free society to that of an authoritarian one. Institutions have become infested with partisans who are incentivized to promote their sides own partisanship in every governmental agency , including the judicial system. The only way to stop this is to reverse the course and size of the Government, make federal power smaller in scale by decentralizing its powers back towards states and local community Governments. However, that requires a severance of the entitlement state , or at minimum an immediate halting of its growth and there in lies the problem. But even that is impossible to sustain and will always be corrected, and it will only be through failure first or a recognition by our population that even though this might be a good enough path for some of us , we now recognize that there is a better path for everyone over the long run that is actually sustainable, self correcting, and self improving for society as a whole , and the longer that environment is sustained, the faster and more people who benefit from it grows over generations. Leave it to the people who complain about the Government to be the same ones who have pushed for expanding it for decades and decades, while pretending on television that more transparency is what makes people distrust them , and not the bare face lies they are monetarily in this environment incentivized to tell , that the regular public has on their own verified and caught them in. I‚Äôm not shocked at all that I would sit here in America and listen to a CNN reporter tell uninformed individuals that the reason the public doesn‚Äôt trust the media is because there is too much transparency, and not enough controlled flow of information by them. The same people everyone has watched and has verified that these people are constantly knowingly lying to the public about important things for money. None of them will stop and do the right thing until the public at large is pushed by natural forces to change its behavior. Whether it be through survival or a recognition of a better path ahead. I think it‚Äôs clear to anyone of serious informed intelligence that all of those charts are showing you that the people who are clinging to the bad ways are on the edge of extreme failure due to inability to recognize and/or constraints that led to failure to change. We can only ride so long as a Country switching back and forth between two systems and trying to use one to prop up the other, and take on the baggage of both at the same time , and refuse to accept the cycle of what will always be inevitable, there are two forces that shape change into what is most beneficial , benefit and non benefit , reward and punishment , profit and loss , it doesn‚Äôt matter which two sets of words you use to describe it , the context, meaning, and truthfulness of it will always be there, no matter what, in every situation, from the individual all the way to the macro societal and economic scale. The effect is circular, no matter where the cause starts. You cannot take away a cost for any action in this system, and we need both tools of beneficial human advancement in order to optimize the successful and abundant growth of humanities future.",

    "text": "Trust depends on validation. Facts are \"real\".   \nThe role of Morality is expressed in the Constitution as consensus.  Trust and Belief are objectively defined.\nWho/what can be believed?  Simple and obvious.\nThere is an unrecognized corollary of freedom.  We are free to be ignorant.  No Human can understand everything.  We understand by focusing on one topic at a time, and we can learn by first-hand experience, as well as from the experiences of others.  We \"trade\" our time and ignorance for the knowledge of others, by trusting with whom we can believe.  We are free to select the authorities we trust.  There are two meanings in English for an \"authority.\"  An authority of fact is not necessary an authority of appointment, and vice versa.   \n\nAn authority of fact is validated in each culture, and there are institutions who are trusted to validate authorities of facts.  For instance, if you need to repair the broken engine in your car, you have two choices: you can spend the time to learn about your engine, buying equipment and parts, and fixing it with your time and labor.  Because there is a market demand for fixing cars, there are experts that you can pay to fix your engine.  You know how to find the one you choose and can trade money you have earned with your time/expertise in exchange for the time/expertise.  You are likely to find that it is almost always advantageous to enlist an expert.  The authorized mechanic has experience, training and the resources earned through years of pursuing the disciplines of his topical expertise.  The same is true with nearly everything we do. You don't grow your own food.  You don't have to, because you can rely on the many experts who harvest food, ship it and present food for your trade. Facts are real.  There are no alternative facts, but there are in infinite number of false hypotheses.\n\nAuthorities can also be those who are assigned power by other authorities.  An authority of power may not be an authority of fact.  In fact, we are experiencing the assignment of power that are not backed by the knowledge and experience necessary to perform the job of being an assigned authority.  \nIf facts are denied and mythologies are used to replace facts, failure can be expected.  There have been a number of organized attacks on \"science\" in the past few decades.  The responsiveness of a free market depends on the growth of businesses in response to any market demand.  \"Free enterprise\" has been conflated as \"capitalism\".  Capitalism is a small part of free enterprise.  In fact, a rapidly growing service business needs little or no capital to then create its own capital from profits.  As businesses expand, they respond to market factors that threaten their institutions.  There are many ways to suppress innovation, and one powerful way is through the control of government regulation.  \n\nIf an authority is assigned to a job with no interest or expertise in that job, that is a fraud to those who are to benefit from that function. The US Constitution and the laws of Congress have progressively developed for centuries.  In the last two decades, the government that is designed to be \"by the people\" and \"for the people\" has become deliberately undermined.  The judicial branch has, with the Chevron decision, removed the expertise of science and replaced it with an impossible task for those with expertise in justice.  In less than a year, the sciences of health are no longer government policy, and the US will continue to experience increased morbidity and mortality.  The new administration appears to recognize that consequential increase in expenses and is divesting itself of any future fiscal responsibility.  The topic of insurance is used to conceal the actual issue of massive decline in the health of the US population.  That problem began in 2022, when a political movement attacked public health and killed over a million people since then.  Private insurance companies did not adjust insurance rates according to the expected expenses related to vaccination, so the overall cost of insurance was not associated with vaccination.  Those who did not get vaccinated were NOT faced with increased insurance rates.  Instead, the burden of the increased expenses were placed on all policy holders.  The customer of private insurances are not primarily those insured.  The actual customers are their employers who denied the need to take actions against the pandemic.  It could be argued that the pandemic could have been isolated and minimized by the political act of closing the US CDC laboratory in Wuhan, China, in 2016, that was there to be an early warning for the emergence of that kind of epidemic.  Now that mythological propagandists have replaced the scientific CDC, there can be no trust in the information provided by the CDC.\n\nThe US government is now in control by the insurrectionists who are enforcing their unilateral policies that are in violation of both the Constitution and congressional laws.  In fact, all internal fiscal transfers are no longer public because of their success in precipitating a \"shut down\".  Simultaneously, Congress has been closed for business, providing no public input of dialog and no oversight of the rogue decisions within the executive branch.  The Supreme Court has declared the tariffs by executive actions to be illegal but have allowed ICE to continue to collect them.  There is no accountability of the ICE employees or their use of the tariff money collected by them.  \n\nRemedies:  Constitutional impeachment is no longer an option, because the perpetrators can't serve on the juries of their own crimes.  Many of the 147 Congressmen who voted to reject the 2020 electors, and to give the victory to candidate Trump on January 6, 2021 remain.  Mike Johnson, who proposed that bill has been rewarded with the position of Speaker of the House.  They believe that they have won their coup, and the people who devised that 2021 coup were paid by the Heritage Foundation to write Project 2025, which is now being implemented.  Project 2026 will follow, which is the \"post-Constitutional\" government that they will install after the \"disestablishment\" of the current government is completed.  Their goal is obviously to codify a system of \"crony capitalism\" to replace democracy.  In corporate terms, they overtly want to replace the role of a President as a Chief Operating Officer to a Chief Executive Officer, which is one of several changes that they can't install outside of their influence on the conspirators in the Supreme Court.  The problems aren't about \"politics\".  The problems that insure the downfall of the US success are all violations of the Constitution and laws... Criminal Corruption.  Many of the states remain unchanged, and the states, counties and cities have always been the institutions that fight the most crime.  They still have the resources and expertise to pursue justice for the criminals in the federal government.  Consequently, the current administration and the Heritage Foundation are attacking the state and local governments with the ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), as well as state and federal armed forces.  If the enormous inefficiencies of corruption are not corrected, the US will collapse into the anarchy created by the loss of order, death and destruction that are inevitable.  The momentum of the economy is already manifested by turmoil and misappropriation of resources.  There appears to be no alternative to the execution of indictments and the incarceration of the criminals to prevent the continuation of this coup of 2021.  The DOJ, OLC, OMB and the Supreme Court have been corrupted, and citizens no longer have standing in federal courts.  When asked how Project 2025 would be implemented, a Heritage Foundation spokesman said that \"the revolution will be bloodless, if the left allows.\"  Since that statement, it has become apparent that \"the left\" to them, means those opposing fascism: the Democrats, and moderates.  They are in opposition to the vast majority of \"we, the people\".   There are many civil servants who take their oath to the Constitution seriously.  They, and the majority of citizens, must remove the criminals from government.",

Now I say take America out of that equation because you only have two political parties. You can vote for here but go across Europe. There are nations where you can vote for multiple political parties. If you‚Äôre dissatisfied with what one group is saying you can go and vote for up to five different viable options. Democracy at work. I guarantee you in China they wish they had a little bit more democracy. They wish they didn‚Äôt have that communist authoritarian regime. Go to some of those other authoritarian nations. They wish they could vote and exercise a little bit more freedom. Our system of democracy is not perfect, but it‚Äôs better than what some people have. Be careful what you wish for because what are your options if you don‚Äôt go with democracy notice everybody seems to go a little bit to the right and they‚Äôre going a little bit more authoritarian. It‚Äôs not because they‚Äôre dissatisfied with democracy. It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs people who want to say my way or the highway. I‚Äôm right you‚Äôre wrong and we should get rid of you. That‚Äôs the problem here you have authoritarian views and perspectives on the rise. It might be a dark time in human history if too many nations embrace this idea because we already know it doesn‚Äôt work out well. We saw what happened when many nations had kings and queens. the people stood up and said, tear it down. Don‚Äôt think it won‚Äôt happen again. If you go back to being an authoritarian nation, the people will stand up and say now we don‚Äôt want just one group one person in charge. What we have now is a bunch of people who have it really good complaining that it‚Äôs not getting better, but in that same breath, a lot of those people don‚Äôt exercise their political rights. A lot of those people don‚Äôt put their ideas out there for what truly needs to be done to fix their problems. We certainly have that problem in America. We have a lot of people complaining, not a lot of people putting forth solutions.\n\nI warn you it‚Äôs gonna get ugly if these people out there globally embrace authoritarian leadership   you‚Äôre gonna have people take over and they‚Äôre not gonna wanna let go  remember we still want to be able to pick and choose who‚Äôs our leader, but you‚Äôre gonna have leaders that want to rule with an iron fist and when they screw up and believe me they will they‚Äôre gonna say I am the authority you can‚Äôt make me do anything  We‚Äôve already seen that happen in other nations go look at Venezuela. They had an authoritarian leader. He said I didn‚Äôt lose the election make me leave.  And imagine if that happened in America. Someone said I did not lose the election. Make me leave.  Wait a minute we came very close to that didn‚Äôt we?",

    "text": "Trump‚Äôs economic policies and authoritarian ambitions are not parallel tracks they are interwoven. \n\nThe deliberate destabilization of the economy serves as both a smokescreen and a scaffold for autocratic consolidation. \n\nRecognizing this pattern is not alarmism; it is a necessary act of democratic vigilance.\n\nThe Engineered Collapse: \nHow Trump‚Äôs \nEconomic Sabotage \nMirrors the Authoritarian Playbook\n\nDonald Trump‚Äôs second-term trajectory reveals a pattern that aligns disturbingly well with the ten-point authoritarian strategy of deliberate economic destabilization. \n\nFar from being a byproduct of mismanagement, the economic distress under his leadership appears increasingly strategic an intentional dismantling of democratic guardrails to entrench personal power.\n\n1. Systematic Middle-Class Erosion  \n\nTrump‚Äôs tax policies and deregulation efforts have disproportionately benefited the ultra-wealthy while hollowing out the middle class. The 2017 tax cuts, extended and deepened in his second term, slashed corporate taxes and capital gains while offering minimal relief to wage earners.\n\nSimultaneously, inflationary pressures exacerbated by trade wars and deregulated monopolies have eroded real wages, leaving middle-income Americans squeezed and politically disempowered.\n\n2. Cultivating Economic Dependency  \n\nBy gutting federal agencies and redirecting relief funds through loyalty-based channels, Trump has fostered a system where access to aid is increasingly politicized. \n\nEmergency relief programs, especially during economic downturns and climate disasters, have been used to reward red states and punish blue ones, creating a dependency matrix that mirrors autocratic patronage systems.\n\n3. Crony Capitalism Ascendant  \n\nIndependent businesses especially those in urban, progressive regions have been undermined by erratic tariffs, regulatory whiplash, and selective enforcement.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump-aligned conglomerates and donors have received preferential treatment, from no-bid contracts to regulatory exemptions. \n\nThis consolidates economic power within a loyalist elite, echoing the oligarchic structures of illiberal regimes.\n\n4. Chaos as a Pretext for Control  \n\nEconomic instability has been weaponized to justify sweeping executive actions. \n\nTrump‚Äôs invocation of the Insurrection Act, threats to deploy the military domestically, and repeated suggestions of suspending elections or overriding state authority all follow the classic authoritarian script: create a crisis, then claim extraordinary powers to solve it.\n\n5. Institutional Defunding and Delegitimization\n  \nPublic universities, independent media, and scientific agencies have faced budget cuts, leadership purges, and smear campaigns. \n\nTrump‚Äôs attacks on the ‚Äúfake news media,‚Äù the ‚Äúdeep state,‚Äù and ‚Äúradical left‚Äù academics serve to delegitimize dissent and dismantle the very institutions that uphold democratic accountability.\n\n6. Scarcity as a Political Weapon  \n\nFrom vaccine distribution to disaster aid, Trump‚Äôs administration has shown a willingness to withhold resources from political opponents. \n\nThis tactic not only punishes dissent but also signals to the public that survival may depend on political loyalty a hallmark of authoritarian regimes.\n\n7. Exhaustion as Suppression  \n\nWith inflation, housing insecurity, and healthcare costs spiraling, Americans are increasingly consumed by day-to-day survival.\n\nThis economic fatigue saps the energy needed for civic engagement, protest, or organizing creating a vacuum in which authoritarianism can flourish unchallenged.\n\n8. Scapegoating and Nationalist Diversions\n  \nTrump‚Äôs rhetoric has consistently blamed immigrants, China, and ‚Äúglobalist elites‚Äù for America‚Äôs economic woes. \n\nThis redirection of blame stokes xenophobia and nationalism, creating a siege mentality that justifies authoritarian crackdowns and distracts from domestic sabotage.\n\n9. Corruption and Asset Seizure  \n\nEconomic downturns have enabled Trump-aligned interests to acquire distressed assets real estate, media outlets, and infrastructure at fire-sale prices. \n\nThis mirrors kleptocratic regimes where economic collapse is a tool for wealth consolidation among the ruling class.\n\n10. Electoral Manipulation via Economic Leverage  \n\nEconomic hardship has been used to suppress voter turnout, particularly in marginalized communities. \n\nCuts to postal services, voter roll purges, and threats to withhold federal funds from states expanding mail-in voting all point to a strategy of economic coercion to undermine electoral competition.",

    "text": "Beware of all religions. ‚ÄúTurn back all of you to God‚Äôs help; practice loyalty and justice and wait always for your God.‚Äù ‚Äì (The Prophet Hosea 12: 6) ‚Äì For God is our true Father. So never worship and pray in the way of the many false prophets who lead all religions: \r\n‚ÄúBut when you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. In your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. Do not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him.\r\nThis is how you should pray:\r\nOur Father in heaven, \r\nHallowed be your name,\r\nYour kingdom come; \r\nYour will be done, on earth as in heaven,\r\nGive us today our daily bread,\r\nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\r\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one.\r\nFor yours is the kingdom, and the power and the glory, for ever.\r\nAmen.\r\nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.‚Äù ‚Äì (The Prophet and Messiah Jesus of Nazareth at Matthew 6: 6-15) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me shall never be hungry, and whoever believes in me shall never be thirsty.‚Äù ‚Äì (at John 6: 35) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúPass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.‚Äù ‚Äì (at Matthew 7: 1-2) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúTruly I tell you, if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.‚Äù ‚Äì (at John 8: 51) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAlways treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\r\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 12-14) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\r\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 10: 9-10) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúBeware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 15) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n ‚ÄúNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 21) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúI am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and any one who is alive and has faith shall never die.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 11: 25-26) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI have not come to judge the world, but to save the world‚Äù ‚Äì (John 12: 47) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúWhoever then will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 10: 32-34) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 14: 6-7) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúAn expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‚ÄòTeacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?‚Äô He answered, ‚ÄòLove the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. Everything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 22: 35-40) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThere is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 15: 13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúDo not call any man on earth ‚Äòfather‚Äô ; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‚Äòteacher‚Äô ; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 23: 9-10) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTake care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 4) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúMany false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men‚Äôs love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. ‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 11-13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTeach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And be assured, I am with you always, to the end of time.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 28: 20) ‚Äì\r\n\r\nYours, in true Spirit and in our one given prayer, 2gointruth, on Sunday the 26th of October 2025: ‚Äì (Please read Matthew 5: 14-16) ‚Äì Where every minute (of both day and night) can be a new beginning for any one of us.",

    "text": "The issue with stand down pacts in the UK is... they dont really work. The last UK general election and this by election both prove that voters are intelligent enough to work out the viable option on their side of politics - lets remember that that total for reform will include people who would rather vote tory, but want to stop labour from the right. The british public are used to and good at tactical voting.\n\nThe issue is that in more and more places it wont be clear who you are meant to back, and if the party people are told to support is labour, they just won't turn up and vote. In 2019 the greens and lib dems entered a pact - in almost every seat where the candidate was the lib dem, green voters hust stayed at home. Historically electoral pacts have only driven turnout down, while campaigns like plaid here drive it up, because labour voters were already planning to vote, so they could be moved to plaid. The challenge will be that UK labour hold the most seats, refuse to cooperate and want to destroy the green party, so even an informal pact will be bascially impossible currently.",

Yes harbor unvetted illegal aliens, don‚Äôt enforce or be soft on crime, be antagonistic to the admin, and obstruct ice!

Imagine what a future Republicans ( a evil man who truly wants to be a dictator) could do with all power to control your health care, money, housing, etc......there is a reason socialism has always failed. And your worried about trump who is promoting capitalism?? America first?? I don't like trumps personality and imo he definitely isn't what the bible describes as holy. However I'd fear the path you guys are taking way more then trump. You guys are trying to set up something scary someday and can't even see it. I'm not a rich man. Poor tbh with you, but I do have wisdom. Use your head people and not trump hate to blind you.",

    "text": "Trump‚Äôs economic policies and authoritarian ambitions are not parallel tracks they are interwoven. \n\nThe deliberate destabilization of the economy serves as both a smokescreen and a scaffold for autocratic consolidation. \n\nRecognizing this pattern is not alarmism; it is a necessary act of democratic vigilance.\n\nThe Engineered Collapse: \nHow Trump‚Äôs \nEconomic Sabotage \nMirrors the Authoritarian Playbook\n\nDonald Trump‚Äôs second-term trajectory reveals a pattern that aligns disturbingly well with the ten-point authoritarian strategy of deliberate economic destabilization. \n\nFar from being a byproduct of mismanagement, the economic distress under his leadership appears increasingly strategic an intentional dismantling of democratic guardrails to entrench personal power.\n\n1. Systematic Middle-Class Erosion  \n\nTrump‚Äôs tax policies and deregulation efforts have disproportionately benefited the ultra-wealthy while hollowing out the middle class. The 2017 tax cuts, extended and deepened in his second term, slashed corporate taxes and capital gains while offering minimal relief to wage earners.\n\nSimultaneously, inflationary pressures exacerbated by trade wars and deregulated monopolies have eroded real wages, leaving middle-income Americans squeezed and politically disempowered.\n\n2. Cultivating Economic Dependency  \n\nBy gutting federal agencies and redirecting relief funds through loyalty-based channels, Trump has fostered a system where access to aid is increasingly politicized. \n\nEmergency relief programs, especially during economic downturns and climate disasters, have been used to reward red states and punish blue ones, creating a dependency matrix that mirrors autocratic patronage systems.\n\n3. Crony Capitalism Ascendant  \n\nIndependent businesses especially those in urban, progressive regions have been undermined by erratic tariffs, regulatory whiplash, and selective enforcement.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump-aligned conglomerates and donors have received preferential treatment, from no-bid contracts to regulatory exemptions. \n\nThis consolidates economic power within a loyalist elite, echoing the oligarchic structures of illiberal regimes.\n\n4. Chaos as a Pretext for Control  \n\nEconomic instability has been weaponized to justify sweeping executive actions. \n\nTrump‚Äôs invocation of the Insurrection Act, threats to deploy the military domestically, and repeated suggestions of suspending elections or overriding state authority all follow the classic authoritarian script: create a crisis, then claim extraordinary powers to solve it.\n\n5. Institutional Defunding and Delegitimization\n  \nPublic universities, independent media, and scientific agencies have faced budget cuts, leadership purges, and smear campaigns. \n\nTrump‚Äôs attacks on the ‚Äúfake news media,‚Äù the ‚Äúdeep state,‚Äù and ‚Äúradical left‚Äù academics serve to delegitimize dissent and dismantle the very institutions that uphold democratic accountability.\n\n6. Scarcity as a Political Weapon  \n\nFrom vaccine distribution to disaster aid, Trump‚Äôs administration has shown a willingness to withhold resources from political opponents. \n\nThis tactic not only punishes dissent but also signals to the public that survival may depend on political loyalty a hallmark of authoritarian regimes.\n\n7. Exhaustion as Suppression  \n\nWith inflation, housing insecurity, and healthcare costs spiraling, Americans are increasingly consumed by day-to-day survival.\n\nThis economic fatigue saps the energy needed for civic engagement, protest, or organizing creating a vacuum in which authoritarianism can flourish unchallenged.\n\n8. Scapegoating and Nationalist Diversions\n  \nTrump‚Äôs rhetoric has consistently blamed immigrants, China, and ‚Äúglobalist elites‚Äù for America‚Äôs economic woes. \n\nThis redirection of blame stokes xenophobia and nationalism, creating a siege mentality that justifies authoritarian crackdowns and distracts from domestic sabotage.\n\n9. Corruption and Asset Seizure  \n\nEconomic downturns have enabled Trump-aligned interests to acquire distressed assets real estate, media outlets, and infrastructure at fire-sale prices. \n\nThis mirrors kleptocratic regimes where economic collapse is a tool for wealth consolidation among the ruling class.\n\n10. Electoral Manipulation via Economic Leverage  \n\nEconomic hardship has been used to suppress voter turnout, particularly in marginalized communities. \n\nCuts to postal services, voter roll purges, and threats to withhold federal funds from states expanding mail-in voting all point to a strategy of economic coercion to undermine electoral competition.",

Curious passersby can easily squint through the tinted windows to catch Siwa, at work in her unglamorous fishbowl.\n\nAn afternoon spent in Siwa‚Äôs company is full of rambling, unrealized observations about the person she is or wants to be.\n\nThe only thing consistent about Siwa is that she‚Äôs very good at making people mad.\n\nThe new new JoJo is even more divisive, mostly because she started dating a man. She‚Äôs toned down her vocal advocacy for LGBTQ rights, alienating some queer fans in the process.\n\nAnd she released a poorly received cover of ‚ÄúBette Davis Eyes‚Äù and an accompanying visual that earned ‚Äútradwife‚Äù comparisons.\nJust months later, Siwa can hardly say the song‚Äôs full title without rolling her eyes.\n\nBut the song stayed on the tour setlist, because she won‚Äôt completely capitulate to the haters and because some people still like it. Siwa said she dreads it every night.\n\nAs a performer, Siwa is a relentless force of positivity, but offstage, she‚Äôs less convincing. Her setlist is split between bubblegum pop she made as a tween plus songs recorded during an era she‚Äôs all but disowned. \n\nShe swears she doesn‚Äôt let the hate ruffle her but also she recently kicked a fan out of a concert for wearing a sweatshirt that appeared to make fun of her hairline.\n\nSiwa sat on the stinky green room couch, eating her bowl in silence, scrolling through TikTok and willing her boyfriend to text her back from across the Atlantic Ocean. \n\nHer new relationship was even cause for celebration among some conservative firebrands. Right-wing personality Benny Johnson celebrated Siwa‚Äôs ‚Äúrebrand from a radical lesbian activist to a straight, trad-girlfriend‚Äù as a victory for the death of ‚Äúwoke.‚Äù B\n\nAt a Turning Point USA event this summer, conservative commentator Michael Knowles announced ‚ÄúJoJo Siwa is no longer a lesbian‚Äù to enormous cheers from his student audience: ‚ÄúNature is healing!‚Äù\n\nShe‚Äôs been shamed and humiliated on screen since she was 9.

She continued making vile digs at, ‚ÄòJojo sat to have her lunch on a sofa in a stinky green room whilst scrolling and willing her boyfriend to text her back from across the Atlantic‚Äô.

    "text": "I‚Äôm gonna say your friend of action was necessary in America. We only discriminated against certain groups of people for a few hundred years. We needed some mechanism to try and right that wrong. We needed some way to help the group of people that were truly discriminated against, and as a result of that discrimination was actively suffering. Actively did not have access to the same opportunities not because of anything they had done, but because they were discriminated against because their parents were discriminated against because they‚Äôre great grandparents were discriminated against because they are great great grandparents were discriminated against my great grandfather was from down south. He was from Georgia. He had to leave Georgia because there was a threat to kill him he was a light skinned male that‚Äôs it. He was too light. He wasn‚Äôt dark enough for the Caucasian population in his area flooded for his life. I‚Äôm not gonna talk about how he had trouble finding a job as a black male down south I‚Äôm not gonna talk about how even when he got up they still would only give him certain jobs here. I‚Äôm just gonna tell you how they literally said we want to kill you because of the light color of your skin you‚Äôre not dark enough to be a black person for white America. Only a few generations ago for me I remember coffee on the porch with my great grandfather in my 20s while he told me this story You should‚Äôve seen the look on my face while he and one of his good friends sat there as if it was common. They made sure to tell me when I went to college don‚Äôt screw it up because they never had the opportunity. Their children were never given the opportunity my mother when she graduated high school her high school guidance counselor didn‚Äôt tell her. Hey you have some pretty good grade you know you should go to college. It‚Äôs right up the street. Nobody even bothered to tell her to look that way she didn‚Äôt know college was an option for her. Her mother didn‚Äôt know college was an option for her. Why? Because they had only been discriminated against as an entire family for a few generations.\n\nFor the record it‚Äôs not that hard to discriminate against someone for their race. We‚Äôve done in America for years while we never looked at race on an application. We would just look at your ZIP Code. We would look at your mother and father‚Äòs income we will look at your level of education and your parents level of education and guess what we can usually determine your race . You may think it‚Äôs a joke, but guess what we know that when we look at a majority of the people coming from urban areas, if we look at a few factors, we can determine with great maturity, whether your black or white not even hard to do businesses have done it for decades so if colleges want to use races a factor but not use race as a factor when bringing in students they can don‚Äôt get mad if they do because corporate America did it for years, nobody said anything when we used race to exclude people from jobsWhy would you get upset when we use race to include people college admissions",

That $38 trillion in debt isn't going away and once things collapse do you think the billionaires will hang around to save you?",

So don‚Äôt give me any bs about ‚ÄúTexas started it‚Äù or ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù let‚Äôs not forget in 2018 the demonrats redistricted five states nowhere near a census year to keep the house from Donald Trump.

The Democrats set the rules when they continued to do this bs year after year, not to mention they are destroying their states with crime and poverty and bs taxes to give away to non citizens etc. this is a matter of saving our constitutional republic. Not democracy‚Ä¶.. Americans are too stupid for democracy and lucky for us the founding fathers knew ppl were stupid and easily manipulated so they wrote a constitution.

Unfortunately, in this case, Texas is stacking the deck and leaves the opposition no other choice but to follow suit or guarantee never being able to have a majority in the Congress again.  This is an example of Trump leadership and his cheating ways and unfortunately the feckless GOP Congress bending the knee.   Unless you have some other realistic options to counter the GOP cheats then you are wrong to call it out as you have",

    "text": "The reality is that unlike in the past the Democrats will now react to whatever the Republicans do in this 'war'. What Republicans need to realise is that the started this some time ago and the Democrats let them, so there is more scope for Democrats because the States where this has largely been left are in the more populous States that are Blue. There is now only one group that can bring this to an end and they make up around a third of the electorate. They are the Independents because while the Republicans may have rezoned to keep the Democrats out in effect they have locked the Independents in. It's now up to them to vote in those Red Districts and vote the Republicans out.",

Nobody is above the law, no passes, no pardons, no way of getting out of charges, answear to the judge for being a lowlife, scumbag thief, & be sentenced appropriately & fairly - everybody involved with no exceptions. Term limits need made into law & enforced by all elected officials. President Trump please get the ball rolling for a vote, by the American people on term limits for All elected officials please!

Those were some nasty tricks the game tried to play with you there, but even more devious were some of those answers you found, never in a million years could I have thought of them. Hearing you two plan the stages felt more like planning moves on a chess board rather than playing car-parkour. Still, the most impressive part of the day has to be Kronii's playlist. If those tunes ever see the light of day more than one therapist is getting kicked to the curb. Maybe the magic was in the journey, maybe you had to left all the rage there on the road to find the true peace at the end. Beautiful if you think about it",

(intensive workload, not meeting deadlines,  little to no sleep, failing my recent graduate review test) \n\nWhenever I make a plan to \"control\" the directions I want to take,  it feels like the world is conspiring to set me away from it everytime. \n\nThe frustration just gets worse and heavier the longer it last. And made me feel down, dissatissfied and useless\n\nThis song blew all that feeling.\n\nThe entire song was the thing I needed to hear. And the second part is my favorite because it really tugged on my personally. \n\nApologies for the trauma dump, but what what I wanted to say is  thank you, for letting me here this.\n(Auto saved so I can play it whenever)",

No matter how ambitious or eccentric the wishes you shared, the enthusiasm in your voice seemed to keep everyone‚Äôs spirits high as the clock ticked! Following up on the Dahlahday teaser from days prior, what you revealed was super exciting! Along with the Dahlahday celebration party, the upcoming Pemascape project sounds really cool! Not to mention the lovely new wallpaper illustrations for your Kaeluarga!\n\nWould like to say sorry for not catching the live last night, but I‚Äôm glad to catch up on the archives before the main birthday stream tonight! Although a 3D performance will have to wait, you‚Äôre clearly proud of what you and your team worked on leading up to the occasion! Just like all of the Pemaloe here, I too look forward to celebrating Dahlahday with you to end this August on a high note! Smelt you later! üî®üéÇ‚ù§Ô∏è",
