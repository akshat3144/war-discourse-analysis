    "text": "Here are some things Jesus Christ said of Himself.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me‚Äù John 14:6\r\n\r\n\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" John 3:16\r\n\r\n\"Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God‚Äôs one and only Son.\" John 3:18\r\n\r\n Jesus asked his disciples, ‚ÄúWho do people say the Son of Man is?‚Äù\r\nThey replied, ‚ÄúSome say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.‚Äù\r\n‚ÄúBut what about you?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúWho do you say I am?‚Äù Simon Peter answered, ‚ÄúYou are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.‚Äù\r\nJesus replied, ‚ÄúBlessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. Matthew 16:13-17 \r\n\r\n Skeptics said for centuries, \"The bible we have now has been corrupted through the years.\". In 1947 the Dead Sea Scrolls were found and proved otherwise. They said, \"There's no way Israel can become a nation again as God promised in preparation for the end times.\". Israel became a nation again in 1948.\r\n\r\n All this being said, it does require faith to believe. Hebrews 11:6 tells us, \"And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.\" Also John 20:27-29 states, \"Then he said to Thomas, ‚ÄúPut your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.‚Äù Thomas said to him, ‚ÄúMy Lord and my God!‚Äù Then Jesus told him, ‚ÄúBecause you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.‚Äù\r\n\r\n Don't be deceived, Jesus is the Son of God and the only way of being saved from God's judgement for our sin. Christ consciousness won't save you. Believing Jesus was an ascended master, a prophet or a good teacher won't save you. Romans 10:9 tells us how to be saved, \"if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved\". Trust in Him, He shed his blood and gave His perfect life for you. Call on Him, He loves you, and He hears you.",

This started latest in 1948 with the first sweeping and deadly forced displacement of Palestinians from their cities, which is on record as the first Nakba. And extremist militias like Hamas founded much later in the mid-80s, are only one of the many results of this 80-year supremacist war by Western powers in a region none of those Western powers are native to. Reputable journalists of the BBC, you need to educate some people here, who think all this has anything to do with October 7th. It hasn't. 7t October is a result of this 80-year history of a supremacist war against people who are classified as having a lesser right to live than others. It's your duty as a reputable news channel in the still democratic world that we all are responsible for keeping in and through these very bad times. You hear this, reputable journalists of the BBC?

As long as they keep trivializing Israeli lives and trying to erase the well-known Jewish connection to the land with weird nonsense lies and cult-like behavior then their opinions should not be relevant to us.\n\nRemember folks, it‚Äôs because of this very ideology that Israel exists and because this very ideology that Palestine doesn‚Äôt exist.

For My name alone shall be exalted in all the earth, and no more shall it be blasphemed among the nations! Says The Lord God.¬†‚Ä®\nNo more shall the enemies of Israel seek to cast off My people, Jacob, for My Name is there! And no more shall any who dwell upon the earth spit upon the name of The King, nor pollute His Word among the people, anymore!

I AM THE LORD!\nTherefore I have indeed set My face to destroy, to break apart and to strip away, until every cracked foundation is exposed and every corrupt house which stands so high and lofty is struck and collapses upon the desolate, until every nation is left in ruins and the whole land is laid waste. For in their loftiness they built high, with no solid foundation beneath them. Thus the weight of their accomplishments shall crush them, until only dust and ashes remain.\nFor I am a great King, says The Lord, The Only God of power and glory who holds infinite might, whose anger is righteous, whose judgment is true and whose justice shall be swift!

Therefore, for the sake of My people and because of My promises, I yet withhold the full weight of My judgment and the power of My wrath; nor shall I flood the face of the earth in My anger, nor drown the nations in the depths of My sorrow. \nFor that which I pour out shall not be a flood of water which covers, but a flood of judgment to destroy, until the pride of man is bowed down and the arrogance of man is utterly humiliated... Says He who overthrew Sodom and destroyed Gomorrah, and punished Egypt with terrible plagues, YAHUWAH, The Creator of Heaven and Earth, THE GOD OF ISRAEL.\n\nYet I shall not make a total end, until every last grain of wheat has been gathered and every last one of the Called is delivered, says The Lord.‚Äù\n\n\n‚Ä®(From The Volumes of Truth, Volume Seven, an excerpt from ‚ÄúVengeance Is Mine, I Shall Repay!‚Äù)",

Yes, there is an element of truth to that but I‚Äôm so f***ing tired of it. Just be happy and celebrate, whichever side you‚Äôre on and just stop complaining for once. 90 Palestinians have been returned. I have no doubt that Palestinians who are there are beyond relief to receive their hostages back, same applies to the Israelis, and yet people still complain. Suck it up and stop whining.",

    "text": "About 90 Palestinian prisoners have been released in exchange for three Israeli hostages handed over by Hamas to Israel, as part of the ceasefire deal aimed at ending 15 months of war.\n\nThe prisoners, most of whom were freed in the early hours of Monday from Ofer prison in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, were welcomed by thousands of people celebrating, waving the flags of Palestine and Hamas.\n\nMothers, fathers, siblings and friends had waited for hours in the cold to embrace their loved ones as part of the agreement.\nAmong those released was Shatha Jarabaa, 24, who was arrested over a social media post criticising the ‚Äúbrutality‚Äù of Israel‚Äôs campaign in Gaza. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy! Thank God I‚Äôm outside. They treated me very bad in prison. It was horrible,‚Äù she told the Guardian\n\nShe was greeted by her father, Nawaf Jarabaa, 63, who said earlier: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy, but not too happy ‚Ä¶ My daughter was arrested simply for expressing her ideas ‚Ä¶ The thing that bothers me the most is that people think that the Israelis have only behaved this way towards us since 7 October, but the truth is that it has always been like this.‚Äô‚Äô\n\nHis anticipation was also tempered by the fact that two other children were not included in the deal.\n\nAnother prisoner released was Ahmad Khsha, 18, who was arrested in January 2024 in Jenin. ‚ÄúThey arrested me because my brother died during a shootout in Jenin. After he died, they arrested me. They raided our cells on Saturday before releasing us and threw teargas at us. They tortured us in the cell, every day. They also tortured and mistreated the women.‚Äù\n\nOsama Shadeh, who was waiting to be reunited with his 17-year-old daughter Aseel, said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to describe the emotion we‚Äôre feeling at this moment.\n\n‚ÄúMy daughter was arrested on 7 November 2024 when she was protesting against the killing of Palestinian children in Gaza. She was waving a Palestinian flag. Israeli soldiers shot her in the foot and handcuffed her. They accused her of trying to stab the soldiers. The fact that she is being released now means that Israel knew that my daughter had done nothing wrong. Yet they kept a minor in jail for over a year.‚Äù\n\nKhawlaha Mahfouz, 53, whose daughter Ayat, 33, from Hebron, was arrested in June 2024 for an attempted stabbing attack also expressed mixed feelings. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy, [but] at the same time, my heart is sad and I don‚Äôt feel ready to celebrate with all that is happening in Gaza.‚Äù\n\nIn Al Fawakeh square in Ramallah, hundreds of people chanted: ‚ÄúThe people want the Al-Qassam Brigades,‚Äù referring to Hamas‚Äô armed wing in Gaza. In the Palestinian Territories, the release of prisoners and the ceasefire was perceived as a victory for Hamas over Israel.\n\nBut in East Jerusalem, the homes of at least four prisoners in East Jerusalem were reportedly raided by Israeli security forces who seized flags and symbols associated with Palestine with soldiers explicitly warning relatives against speaking to the media.\n\nThe Israel Prison Service said on Friday that it would take measures to prevent any ‚Äúpublic displays of joy‚Äù by families of Palestinian prisoners released in the deal.\nOn Sunday, three women held hostage by Hamas in tunnels beneath Gaza, Damari, 28, Romi Gonen, 24 and Doron Steinbrecher, 31, were released and reunited with their mothers. Videos showed them in apparent good health though they are expected to spend a few days in hospital.\n\nIn one video Damari, who lost two fingers when she was shot the day she was abducted, smiled and hugged her mother as she held up a bandaged hand.\n\nThe first phase of the truce took effect following a three-hour delay during which Israeli warplanes and artillery pounded the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe last-minute blitz killed 13 people, Palestinian health authorities said. Israel claimed it had struck terrorists although Al Jazeera reported that at least two missiles hit a family travelling on a donkey cart as they tried to return home. The attack killed Ahmed al-Qidra and two of his seven children, the broadcaster reported.\n\nMinutes after the truce began, the United Nations said the first trucks carrying desperately needed humanitarian aid had entered the Palestinian territory.\nAn Egyptian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said ‚Äú260 trucks of aid and 16 of fuel‚Äù had moved into the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza and the Nitzana crossing between Egypt and Israel before entering Gaza.\nThousands of displaced Palestinians also set off across the landscape to return home. In the northern area of Jabalia, hundreds streamed down a sandy path, heading to an apocalyptic landscape piled with rubble and destroyed buildings.\n\n‚ÄúWe are finally in our home. There is no home left, just rubble, but it‚Äôs our home,‚Äù said Rana Mohsen, 43, back in Jabalia.\nThere is no detailed plan in place to govern Gaza after the war, much less rebuild it. Nine in 10 homes have been destroyed as well as schools, hospitals, shops, mosques and cemeteries.\n\nThe World Health Organization said on Sunday it was ready to pour aid into the territory, but that it would need ‚Äúsystematic access‚Äù across the territory to do so. Until the truce, Israel had complete control over the volume and nature of aid allowed into Gaza, leaving it on the verge of famine several times.\n\nWarning that the ‚Äúhealth challenges ahead are immense‚Äù, the Geneva-based agency put the cost of rebuilding just the health system at ‚Äúbillions in investment‚Äù.\n‚ÄúToday the guns in Gaza have gone silent,‚Äù US President Joe Biden said on his last full day in office, welcoming a truce that had eluded US diplomacy for more than a year. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve reached this point today because of the pressure Israel built on Hamas, backed by the United States.‚Äù\nUnder the first phase of the deal reached between Israel and Hamas, which is to last 42 days, the militant group has agreed to release 33 hostages including children, women (including female soldiers) and men aged over 50, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli jails.\nIn the second phase of the ceasefire deal, the remaining living hostages are due to be sent back and a corresponding ratio of Palestinian prisoners will be freed, and Israel will completely withdraw from the territory. The specifics are subject to further negotiations, which are due to start 16 days into the first phase.\nThe third phase will address the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and Hamas members, and a reconstruction plan for Gaza will be launched. Arrangements for future governance of the strip remain hazy.\n\nAbout 100 of the Palestinian prisoners slated for release are serving life sentences for violent attacks on Israelis; others were jailed for lesser offences, including social media posts, or held in administrative detention, which allows for the pre-emptive arrest of individuals based on undisclosed evidence.\nAccording to a copy of the agreement seen by the Guardian, nine ill and wounded Israelis will be released in exchange for 110 Palestinians serving life sentences in Israeli jails.\n\nAbout 180 prisoners will reportedly be deported to Turkey, Qatar and Algeria.\nMen aged over 50 on the list of 33 hostages will be released in return for prisoners serving life sentences at a ratio of 1:3, and 1:27 for other sentences.\nAccording to figures published by the Israeli NGO HaMoked, as of January 2025 there were 10,221 Palestinians in Israeli prisons. About 3,376 of them are held under administrative detention, while 1,886 are classified as ‚Äúunlawful combatants‚Äù, which also allows detention without charge or trial. The Israel Defense Forces and Israeli government say the measures comply with international law.\n\nPalestinians have long alleged that imprisonment is a key element of Israel‚Äôs 57-year-old occupation: various estimates suggest that up to 40% of Palestinian men have been arrested at least once in their lives.\n\nReuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",

    "text": "Shall we recall back to 1916 when Britain promised Palestine for a Jewish homeland (but there were indigenous Muslims and Christians ALREADY THERE). As well as Jews (many stories of beautiful, respectful relations) prior to British interference.  Massive numbers of Jewish people from other places in the world were brought in.  Britain stayed there until 1948 and prepped Jews for their own state.   For decades there zionists distributed resources in a horrifically unjust manner --- taking land, water, dignity, freedom, lives from the Palestinians who were ALREADY THERE.  There is a misunderstanding that this area is promised to the Jews by God.  Are the people committing a genocide for land people of faith? Their own sincerely religious cry out to stop (that even the Torah does not permit such horrible acts).  Look how these people treat their own sincerely religious.  The Palestinians are fighting for freedom against some of the most serious injustice we have seen in our time.  May each of us be courageous and seek out the real truth and stand for it however we can.  EVERY PERSON, EVERY EFFORT CAN make A HUGE DIFFERENCE God-willing not only in this life but perhaps most importantly when we will all stand before our Creator and we will be asked about every thing that we did or said.  \"Every soul will taste death, and you will only be given your compensation on the Day of Resurrection.  So he who is drawn away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise has attained.  And what is the life of this world except the enjoyment of delusion.  You will surely be tested in your possessions and in yourselves.  And you will surely hear things from those who were given the Scripture before you and from those who associated others with God much abuse.  But if you are patient and mindful / fearing of God -- indeed that is of the matters of resolve. And mention when God took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture, 'You must make it clear to the people and not conceal it.' But they threw it away behind their backs and exchanged it for a small price.  And wretched is that which they purchased.  And never think that those who have rejoiced in what they have perpetrated and like to be praised for what they did not do -- never think them in safety from the punishment, and for them is a painful punishment.  And to God belongs the dominion the heavens and the earth and God is over all things competent.\" from Quran Chapter Ali Imran = The Family of Imran. (Imran is the father of Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus, may peace be on him (a beloved Prophet in Islamic tradition).  Also Imran is the name of the father of Moses & Aaron, may peace and blessings be on them as well both Prophets in Islamic tradition.",

Completely discredited evil propaganda outlet. As the world watches the UK's children get raped by the exact same Islamists who have raped and killed Israeli women and girls in there homes we wonder if the UK will survive the next few decades. Judging from the sick commenters the American people will soon demand the US pulls out of Nato and leave the UK to fight the Russians and Putin's Hamas allies. How sad it is to watch Great Britain, the country that first made slavery illegal, gave the world Democracy, the scientific revolution, freedom of the press degrade into a backwards country as it allows Fascists to illegally cross poor into its borders.",

They also denied food and medicine to civilians. \nIn consequence, Israel showed it's true face to the west and particularly the Americans, now it's up to Americans to decide if need Israel to ruin their image by offering them billions of dollars in arms.",

Shame on Biden and his Zionist criminal administration, Sunak and Starmer and their governments for being fully complicit in this genocidal war and crimes against humanity in Gazza and W Bank and Lebanon. History and humanity as well as the victims of this manmade horrendous conflict will remember you all with total contempt! It takes time, patience and enormous suffering but humanity eventually will prevail over evils ‚ÄúZionism, fascism and Nazism‚Äù as it did in September 1945!",

    "text": "‚ÄúGod is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.‚Äù ‚Äì (The Prophet and Messiah Jesus of Nazareth at John 4: 24) ‚Äì For God is our true Father. So never worship and pray in the way of all religions. \r\n‚ÄúBut when you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you openly.\r\nIn your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. Do not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him.\r\nThis is how you should pray:\r\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\r\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\r\nGive us today our daily bread,\r\nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\r\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one.\r\nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever.\r\nAmen.\r\nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.‚Äù ‚Äì (Jesus the Messiah at Matthew 6: 6-15) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúPass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.‚Äù ‚Äì (at Matthew 7: 1-2) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúIn truth I tell you, if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.‚Äù ‚Äì (at John 8: 51) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAlways treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\r\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 12-14) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\r\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 10: 9-10) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúBeware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 15) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 21) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúI am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and any one who is alive and has faith shall never die.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 11: 25-26) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI have not come to judge the world, but to save the world‚Äù ‚Äì (John 12: 47) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúWhoever then will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 10: 32-34) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 14: 6-7) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAn expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‚ÄòTeacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?‚Äô He answered, ‚ÄòLove the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. Everything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 22: 35-40) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThere is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 15: 13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúDo not call any man on earth ‚Äòfather‚Äô ; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‚Äòteacher‚Äô ; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 23: 9-10) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTake care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 4) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúMany false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men‚Äôs love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. ‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 11-13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTeach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And be assured, I am with you always, to the end of time.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 28: 20) ‚Äì\r\n\r\nYours, in true Spirit and in our one given prayer, 2gointruth, on Sunday the 19th of January 2025: ‚Äì (Please read Matthew 5: 14-16) ‚Äì Where every minute (of both day and night) can be a new beginning for any one of us. Let it always be you. Pray to God often, as prescribed above, before it is too late.",

    "text": "it just breaks my heart how the media, the israeli and western public and governments can give so much air time and empathy to the israeli hostage families, going with them through every moment of suffering, of waiting, pointing out the horror of a family member being abducted out of their sleep- without pointing out that the exact same thing is and has been happening to thousands and thousands of palestinian families! its the same suffering, the same horror, the same human feelings. WHERE is the empathy for those families? its such a profound double standard that is only possible because the muslims have been so profoundly dehumanised in the western/israeli  narrative for decades. no, they dont suffer like us these muslim mothers, they are not like us, we dont seem to be able to empathise with them. its heartbreaking, not only for them, but for us, as it shows the state of our own hearts",

Totally disgusting!! I am incredibly angry that the BBC is acting as a racist mouthpiece for a racist government!!! Everything to do with this ceasefire has been clarified and sorted by the negotiators, it is NOT Hamas, it IS Israel playing it's usual dirty games!!!! All this information is known and witnessed, how can such an apparantly great news company NOT know the truth????? Of they do, they just choose not to present it. I wish that all the great reporters would resign from the BBC and set up their own organization!!!",

    "text": "The US Congressional War Resolution on 9/11 gave clear directive: ‚ÄúThe President is authorized to use all necessary & appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons\". \nThe US failed as its anti-terrorism operations in Afghanistan were undertaken selectively against some terrorists and not against Pakistan which had sheltered terrorist organizations & UNSC designated terrorists. To milk US dollars by prolonging Afghan War, Pakistan fooled US with double game by clandestinely arming Taliban. Pakistani based terrorist leaders were directing terrorists to kill Westerners in 2008 Mumbai attacks, OBL was found in a safe house in Pakistan in 2011. \nAll this did not alert US & 10 yrs later in 2021, the US with its NATO allies rightly faced defeat, endured massive loss of blood & treasure and got ignominious expulsion from Afghanistan sullying America's global image. \nMeanwhile, Pakistan with support of Qatar & Turkey in 2014 even transferred millions of Jihadi-infiltrated Muslim immigrants into Europe via Syria (Carlotta Gall, The New York Times Feb 7, 2016). Europe is suffering because of faulty policies of the US. \nIsrael mustn't do the US folly. Israel must address the root cause which is Israel cannot co-exist with Evil. Israel must bring all Palestinian territories including Gaza under its complete security oversight for several yrs till the threat of Evil ideology ends permanently. If Hamas is let off this time, a new incarnation of Hamas with much more lethal weapons will rise in future making the Oct-7 barbaric attacks look a pedestrian affair. Israel may also lose air superiority advantage next time around. The stark choice for Israel is now or never.",

Israel's standing on the international stage and its relations with the Arab world have been severely damaged.

All these words contain the letters \"ayin\" and \"tzadeh\" which together spell \"etz\", meaning a tree, symbolic of standing alone in strength and independent, like an English oak. We can see the complicated interplay of meaning and root meanings in these words. Bowen's somewhat ominous and simplistic translation is just that, simplistic and unnuanced.",

The BBC has sunk to new lows of illogic.  One could have shown NAZI Germany in the same light (as the Palestinians) as the Holocaust proceeded - if one was equally selective in the coverage.\n\nPalestinians are the world's worst losers.  Choosing scenes such as this over acceptance of loss, change - and peace.  The BBC aids and abets the evil that is Hamas, and perpetuates misery, suffering and death.",

The dead Palestinian children were only being raised to hate Jews and want to murder them, the women were responsible for instilling that hatred in their children, and the men that joined Hamas were more interested in building terror tunnels and launching rockets indiscriminately into Israeli civilian areas than looking after their own people! The international aid money that was sent to Gaza was squandered on rockets and keeping the endemically corrupt Hamas leadership in luxurious comfort in Qatar, and yet the world is supposed to feel sorry for the Palestinians now that they're suffering? \n\nAs Golda Meir once said, \"There will be peace in the Middle East only when the Arabs love their children more than they hate Israel.\" That was true then, and it's still true now!",

    "text": "‚ÄúLet hope keep you joyful ; in trouble stand firm ; persist in prayer.‚Äù ‚Äì (Romans 12: 12) ‚Äì \r\nFor God is our true Father in heaven and on earth. So never worship and pray in the way of all religions: \r\n‚ÄúBut when you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you openly.\r\nIn your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. Do not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him.\r\nThis is how you should pray:\r\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\r\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\r\nGive us today our daily bread,\r\nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\r\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one.\r\nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever.\r\nAmen.\r\nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.‚Äù ‚Äì (The Prophet and Messiah Jesus of Nazareth at Matthew 6: 6-15) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúPass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.‚Äù ‚Äì (at Matthew 7: 1-2) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúIn truth I tell you, if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.‚Äù ‚Äì (at John 8: 51) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAlways treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\r\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 12-14) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\r\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 10: 9-10) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúBeware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 15) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 21) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúI am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and any one who is alive and has faith shall never die.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 11: 25-26) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI have not come to judge the world, but to save the world‚Äù ‚Äì (John 12: 47) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúWhoever then will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 10: 32-34) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 14: 6-7) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAn expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‚ÄòTeacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?‚Äô He answered, ‚ÄòLove the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. Everything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 22: 35-40) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThere is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 15: 13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúDo not call any man on earth ‚Äòfather‚Äô ; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‚Äòteacher‚Äô ; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 23: 9-10) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTake care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 4) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúMany false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men‚Äôs love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. ‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 11-13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTeach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And be assured, I am with you always, to the end of time.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 28: 20) ‚Äì\r\n\r\nYours, in true Spirit and in our one given prayer, 2gointruth, on Thursday the 16th of January 2025: ‚Äì (Please read Matthew 5: 14-16) ‚Äì Where every minute (of both day and night) can be a new beginning for any one of us. Let it always be you. Pray to God often, as prescribed above, before it is too late.",

    "text": "With a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas now in place, celebrations have already erupted in Gaza, the West Bank, Tehran, Beirut, and other regions where Hamas garners support. Even in Western cities like New York and London, demonstrations claiming ‚Äúvictory‚Äù will take place.\n\nMany delusional statements are already being made by pro-Hamas groups around the world.\n\nWithin Our Lifetime, a pro-Hamas group in New York, says, ‚ÄúResistance has won‚Ä¶.‚ÄúImperialism and Zionism has lost, the Democratic party has lost, the future of the Zionist state continues to be eroded,‚Äù group leader Nerdeen Kiswani says in a statement.\n\nThe Palestinian Youth Movement in New York announces a rally in Times Square tomorrow. ‚ÄúPalestinians in Gaza have not only survived, but shown the world that they will continue to rise until liberation,‚Äù it says.\n\nNational Students for Justice in Palestine calls the agreement ‚Äúa step forward on the long, arduous path to Palestine‚Äôs inevitable victory.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe people of Gaza chose to resist,‚Äù NSJP says.\n\nBut let‚Äôs take a closer look at the cost of this so-called ‚Äúvictory‚Äù.\n\nHamas has suffered catastrophic losses. When journalists eventually walk the streets of Gaza, they will find entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble. The group‚Äôs leadership has been decimated‚ÄîYahya Sinwar, the mastermind behind much of their strategy, is dead. Mohammed Deif, their infamous military commander, is also confirmed dead, leaving Hamas without its key architects of terror. Over 30,000 Hamas fighters have been killed, including senior operatives like Ayman Nofal and Jawad Abu Shamala. Tragically, even innocent lives, including many children, have been lost in the chaos.\n\nIs this really a victory?\n\nFor the people of Gaza, life has been shattered. The Strip‚Äôs already fragile infrastructure has been obliterated. Hospitals, schools, and homes lie in ruins. Many residents now live in tents, relying on dwindling humanitarian aid. This suffering and devastation‚Äîwhat has it achieved? The release of a few thousand prisoners? History shows that Israel‚Äôs security forces and the IDF will likely neutralize many of them within a few years.\n\nMeanwhile, Hezbollah‚Äôs attempt at solidarity‚Äîfiring tens of thousands of rockets at Israel‚Äîhas led to its own collapse. Key leaders have been eliminated, including its secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah, whose death marked a devastating blow to the group‚Äôs operations. Lebanon‚Äôs already crumbling infrastructure has suffered from Israeli retaliatory strikes, leaving Hezbollah weakened and its power base in disarray.\n\nIran, the chief backer of both Hamas and Hezbollah, is struggling under mounting internal protests, international sanctions, and economic instability. Its resources are stretched thin, with its influence in Syria under threat as Israel continues to target Iranian proxies and infrastructure there. The Assad regime is now history, with not a single piece of military equipment left in Syria. Iranian air defenses are wide open, and nuclear facilities are vulnerable to an easy attack.\n\nHamas‚Äô actions have brought nothing but devastation to Gaza, ruin to its allies, and suffering to its people. The region is in chaos, the hands of progress turned back decades, if not a century. Calling this a ‚Äúvictory‚Äù is not just misleading‚Äîit‚Äôs a tragic disservice to those who continue to bear the brunt of this senseless conflict.\n\nHamas and its supporters must ask themselves: What was gained? At what cost? And for what future?",

But why, when it comes to Palestinians, it‚Äôs a completely different story? We understand, and we‚Äôve been taught as a young man, I‚Äôve been always taught, that the world cares about the human rights of every single person in the world. But I haven‚Äôt seen any of those human rights as a Palestinian. What have I got to do with this war so I was subjected to this scale of barbarism and this starvation and this cold and just all of these diseases? Even right now while I‚Äôm talking you, Amy, I‚Äôve been diagnosed with bronchitis. I‚Äôm still recovering from it. There are no right or proper medications inside any of the pharmacies here in Deir al-Balah, where more than a million people are taking shelter. Even if we‚Äôre talking about it in detail, the lack of medical supplies and aid inside the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital here, which serves more than 1.5 million people in central Gaza, apart from the everyday ‚Äî¬†from everyday casualties, is literally insane.",

The PEOPLE voted in Hamas, the PEOPLE support Hamas.. the PEOPLE meet the same fate as Hamas. Do you ever wonder WHY neighboring countries didn't take more Palestinian people during this crisis? You might want to read up on some history.  Personally, I wish NONE of this had happened as WAR is TERRIBLE! Egos fighting Egos equals catastrophic loss of life, which is ABOSOLUTLY SENSELESS!",

    "text": "Meta AI says...\n\nThe Bible does mention Gaza, a city located in the territory of the Philistines, in several passages. Here are some references:\n\nProphecies of Destruction\n1. *Amos 1:6-8* - \"This is what the Lord says: 'For three sins of Gaza, even for four, I will not turn back my wrath. Because she took captive whole communities and sold them to Edom, I will send fire on the walls of Gaza, and it will consume her fortresses.'\"\n2. *Zephaniah 2:4-7* - \"Gaza will be abandoned and Ashkelon left in ruins. At midday Ashdod will be emptied and Ekron uprooted. Woe to you who live by the sea, you Kerethite people... The Lord will destroy the Philistines, the remnant from the island of Caphtor.\"\n\nReasons for Destruction\nAccording to the Bible, Gaza was to be destroyed due to its:\n\n1. *Treaty-breaking and violence* (Amos 1:6-8) - Gaza had a history of breaking treaties and engaging in violent acts, including selling entire communities into slavery.\n2. *Idolatry and false worship* (Zephaniah 2:11) - The Philistines, including those living in Gaza, worshipped false gods and idols.\n3. *Pride and arrogance* (Zephaniah 2:15) - Gaza and the Philistines were proud and arrogant, believing they were secure and invincible.\n\nHistorical Fulfillment\nGaza has experienced various periods of destruction and occupation throughout history, including:\n\n1. *Assyrian conquest* (732 BCE): The Assyrian Empire, under King Tiglath-Pileser III, conquered Gaza and the Philistine cities.\n2. *Babylonian conquest* (586 BCE): The Babylonian Empire, under King Nebuchadnezzar II, conquered Gaza and the Philistine cities.\n3. *Roman conquest* (63 BCE): The Roman Empire, under General Pompey, conquered Gaza and the surrounding region.\n\nWhile the Bible's prophecies about Gaza's destruction were fulfilled in history, it's essential to recognize that the Bible's message is not one of hate or revenge but rather a call to repentance, justice, and mercy.",

The women released by Hamas were smiling and looked happy and healthy!! The women released by Israel were crying and one wouldn‚Äôt stop saying how she thought she would die how they were killing her, she kept crying to her mom, ‚Äúthey were killing me, they were killing me‚Äù!  Compare Palestinian before and after photos who had been held for 3 months by Israel and released to before and after photos of those women hostages held for 15 months and released and you will see the women look exactly the same but Israel‚Äôs hostages after just 3 months look withered and significantly skinnier, starved and have marks and bruises all over their bodies from torture!  Why is it American never talks about Palestinians and their suffering at the hands of IDF?!!  It is always Hamas started this, Hamas did that, when Hamas is not shooting snd killing anyone, the IDF is!",

Hamas is an extension of the Gazan people, its the armed wing of a radicalized population. They have held the whole world hostage with their false claims to the land, their invented Palestine. Its always been the dirty secret if the Arab world, that their leaders created the lie of the existence of a Palestinain people or a Palestinian country. These are Arabs, not Palestinians. Now, they should leave and never come back.",

    "text": "There's no way Trump would be harder on Israel than Biden, Trump is all in for support of Israel, including even controversial points like Jerusalem. The more interesting factor is the way Hamas is still in charge. This would be like Hitler and his SS still being in charge of Germany after the second world war. Both Israel and Hamas are dead against a two state solution, so leaving Hamas in charge cements the destiny of Palestinian civilians for at least another generation. I'm interested to learn if the UN has learned anything about its role in promoting a culture solely focused on destruction of Israel for the past few generations. Until they understand that, Palestine is doomed.",

Why is pretty much everybody involved fully admitted that it was Trump's ambassadors that he personally sent over there they got the final push? The same reason that Putin now wants peace talks with Ukraine. Biden was a waste and no one took him seriously, Trump is a leader and everyone took him seriously) and Trump is your president for the next 4 years, enjoy it because you all deserve it. :)",

The only reason that a peace deal was even truly considered was because Trump was coming back. The only reason a true peace deal is being put in the works between Russia and Ukraine is because Trump is coming back. The only reason things turned around for the better and world politics are improving overnight essentially is because Trump is coming back.

As he said, he framed this same deal months ago. Ya but they didn‚Äôt agree to it until trump won and  spoke up and told them to agree to a deal. Nice try and we all know this is because of trump. Biden is a push over and not a threat to them. Otherwise this would of been done when he first presented that same deal. Trump is unpredictable they fear him, he told um you have X amount of time, and wow what a coincidence. They stopped right before he got in just like he asked. this is why he was voted in overwhelmingly. The country needs someone with ballssss leading it. A man who gets shott and immediately stands up instead of staying down for cover. Ya thats the guy to get it done",

History will show him as one of the worst (if not the worst) president in US history. It reminds me of the release of hostages when Reagan went it. Biden got us into WWIII. (Yes, WW 3 - there are 30 nations including the USA involved in this Ukraine war. The news is not telling the truth. If that's not a WW then what is it?  The news owners have their own agenda and it's not the betterment of the populous. If a Republican were in the white house the news would have been yelling WW 3 in nauseum.)",

    "text": "I feel sick to my stomach.  The US kept this war alive for the entire duration of the 15 months and for decades before by supporting and enabling Israel to maintain their reign of apartheid over Palestinians that has been going on for over 75 years.  In this ONE \"war\": there are 46,000+ dead, generations gone and the \"neighbourhoods\" don't exist anymore, nothing but rubble.  So very happy for Palestinians but the audacity that allows the US government to continue to live in the realm of \"we played no part\" is unbelievable to me.  The US, amongst other countries, funded, supported, sold arms, provided funding and aid for decades to Israel which enabled Benny and his predecessors to keep seven generations of Palestinians living like animals and treated like animals.  The fact that Qatar, Egypt and the UN had to stay in the fight to broker this deal says it all, it sure as hell wasn't Blinken's contribution which equals zero. The question still remains, will Israel give the Palestinian's back their land, their country, their right to self-directed democracy or is this just another \"pause\" in what is sure to be yet another \"conflict\" with Israel.  There is no discussion or foundation to support the suggestion that Israel is entitled to that land, absolutely nothing.  There are declarations, and documents to back that up the only people who don't seem to want to accept that is the Israeli government, I won't say the people of Israel because I want to believe they are as tired of this as the Palestinians are.  Next and final question, does Benny still get tried as a war criminal or does he get a get out of jail free card because, assuming Israel does complete this deal?  My guess is the answer is yes, be gets to walk, why, because the US supports it.  That's my rant.  I'm not looking for a discussion or a debate, I said what I said and that's the end of it.  And before you ask, yes, I have done my research, years of it, years of living as one of the most hated races on the earth, in the \"free world\" no less; a Palestinian.",

    "text": "The Oppressed of Al-Foua and Kafraya: Wounds That Never Heal and a Shameful International Silence\n\nWhile Syria was torn apart by war, the villages of Al-Foua and Kafraya witnessed one of the most harrowing examples of oppression and suffering. Thousands of civilians were besieged under inhumane conditions, left to face death by starvation and relentless bombardment, all while the international community remained complicit in its disgraceful silence‚Äîignoring the cries of those trapped inside.\n\nYears of Siege: A Slow Death\n\nFrom 2015 to 2018, armed factions imposed a suffocating siege on Al-Foua and Kafraya, cutting off food and medical supplies. The residents lived on the brink of death every single day. Children perished due to malnutrition, the sick died without access to treatment, and all the while, artillery and airstrikes pounded the villages, leaving no place safe.\n\nDeadly Starvation: Families were forced to eat leaves and grass just to survive.\n\nContinuous Bombardment: Homes, schools, and hospitals were not spared from attacks.\n\nInternational Failure: Despite repeated pleas for help, the United Nations and global powers turned a blind eye to the catastrophe.\n\n\nThe Rashideen Massacre: From One Death Trap to Another\n\nAfter years of endurance, an agreement was reached to evacuate the residents of Al-Foua and Kafraya as part of the so-called ‚ÄúFour Towns Deal.‚Äù But even in their moment of escape, they were met with yet another atrocity.\n\nOn April 15, 2017, as the evacuees waited at the Rashideen checkpoint for the exchange process, a vehicle loaded with food aid for children approached them. As desperate children and their families gathered around, the vehicle suddenly exploded, transforming their hope into yet another nightmare. More than 100 people‚Äîmostly women and children‚Äîwere killed, their bodies torn apart in a scene of unimaginable horror.\n\nWhy Did the World Stay Silent?\n\nWhile Al-Foua and Kafraya suffered, the global media chose to ignore their plight, exposing a blatant double standard in how human tragedies are reported. Had this massacre occurred elsewhere, the world would have been flooded with outrage, condemnation, and demands for justice. But because the victims of Al-Foua and Kafraya did not fit the political narratives of the West, their suffering was systematically erased from the global conscience.\n\nAl-Foua and Kafraya: A Wound That Bears Witness to Injustice\n\nEven after escaping the siege, the suffering of Al-Foua and Kafraya‚Äôs people is far from over. Many remain displaced, having lost their homes and loved ones, carrying with them only memories of pain and death. This tragedy will forever stand as a mark of shame on the world‚Äôs conscience, a testament to how not all victims are treated equally in the eyes of the international community‚Äîa world that selectively trades in human suffering based on political agendas.\n\nThe oppressed of Al-Foua and Kafraya will never be forgotten. Their voices will continue to cry out to the world: Where were you when we were starving and dying under relentless fire?",

Most generally agree that it is a individual or group not controlled by a government that attacks others, including civilians, in the hopes of achieving a political goal. But even that one is vague and there are still a thousand other ways to define it.\n\nSecond, the history of the word shows the inherent bias in it‚Äôs conception. It was created during the French Revolution by aristocrats to discredit the revolutionaries fighting against the monarchy.\n\nIn short, using the word ‚Äôterrorist‚Äô to describe a rival faction is just a fancy way of saying ‚ÄùI‚Äôm the good guy, you‚Äôre the bad guy‚Äù.",

    "text": "The hypocrisy is staggering. Despite overwhelming evidence of Israel killing innocent civilians in Gaza, the U.S. continues to frame these actions as \"self-defence\" and turns a blind eye to the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Yet, they suddenly express concern for Syrian civilians under areas controlled by Al-Qaeda. At the same time, they endorse Israel's incursions into Syrian territory, beyond the Golan Heights, still labeling it as \"self-defence.\" The double standards are blatant, revealing a selective approach to human rights and international law.",

    "text": "All of Israel belongs to the Jewish people that fully includes Judea Samaria which is a huge part of Jewish history, it was the very land that Jesus walked upon and Jesus never mentioned an arab people called pallys because they never existed. Every single arab muslims, recently renamed pallys, all left their arab muslim lands of their origin to occupy Israel and they can live in peace in Israel's Judea Samaria and Israel can build as many settlements as they choose to in Judea Samaria for a growing Jewish population and if they do not like it they can all return to their own arab muslim lands of their origin. Israel is in their indigenous land and no arab muslim nation ever existed upon the land of Israel, even the pally name palestine is not arab muslim, it was the Romans who changed the name of Israel to palestine it had nothing to do with any arab nation and no arab, then arab muslims, ever took this name upon themselves. Even these new pallys only took this name upon themselves in the 60s when the terrorists arafat started the p.l.o. he gave them this name and since then they have raised they children to believe that they are an ancient people who always lived in the land of Israel. When it is Israel who is an ancient people who lived upon the land of Israel for 3500yr. The arabs are an ancient people who all lived in their own arab nations were these pallys came from to occupy Israel. But these pallys never were an people indigenous to Judeas Samaria but we know that the Jews people are. The pallys believe their own lies that they have told their children for 4 generations that the land of Israel was always theirs and the Jews came and took it away from them, another total lie, Israel accepted a partition of trans Jordan only a small part of what Israel should be, and they arab muslims who were just arab muslims then reject their offer that never should have been offered to them in the first place.  All of Israel belongs to the Jewish people and they will one day have all their nation back. and there will not be an arab muslim in the land of Israel, unless Israel welcomes them.",

Jesus christ are lord an savior is coming to get us. he will come in shout of the archangel saying your name and to come up here, with the trumpet blowing all across earth that can make a world wide earthquake. dead and alive will change to body like christ an rise to meet to lord to heaven, an being rapture ready simple an easy. 1. believe that Jesus died on the cross and spilled his own blood for your sins (past, present, and future), was buried and rose on the third day from the dead in glory, heart and soul an meaning. 2. admit your a sinner and your need him to save you. 3. you pray to him on part 1 and 2 an repent your sins on him and his blood and in faith and trust and believe in him to save you. also try in these last days to walk like christ, if you messed up or sin, don panic for your sins are payed by his blood. past, present, and future sins. his morals and ways are greater then are own and i asks you seek not sinning as possible to show god you care about him. his blood cleans you and forgives you of sins. Because as Scripture say. \"throw faith and grace you are save not by your own works yet anyone can boast\". if reading this part you been left behind to face gods wraith and face the mark of the beast. were a person will have it on there right hand or forehead. it will be the only way to buy and sell anything. taking this mark is a unforgivable sin and forever dam to the second death. So if you stay behind don‚Äôt take the mark stay in faith to Jesus and resist cause they will chop your head off, let it happen if captured. For this time will be hell on earth. Lucifer/antichrist will force you to take it. Do not accept it choose death. i pray you and many get saved and my fellow christians spread the word. Jesus loves us and nothing can separate us from him and faith and grace gets us saved. salvation and eternal life is a free gift from god nothing we earned or gained. Please it is important to spread this message to many. Jesus is your only way to avoid it. the signs are showing, more disasters and wars and suffering has increase dramatically. i pray to all see the true and believe.this is serious we may go any day now. ask an he will help you. An keep your bibles safe they will guide you in grand tribulation and Lucifer will try to destroy them. once we leave there be ww3, attacks on Israel and must of major powers destroyed. For there be 21 wraiths on this earth 7 seals, 7 trumpets, and 7 bowels. that will make earth be hell on earth and most of the population would be dead so preparers you will not survived nor win against Lucifer. also there be two witnesses who will preach the news for the first half of the tribulation, kill by Lucifer and resurrected on the third day and rise back to heaven. there be disasters and plagues like rivers an oceans to blood, water turning bitter/poisonous and leads to some to death by wormwood astroid, scorpion with human like face and crowns will give those who have not accepted christ agonizing pain an people wont die when this plague happen for five months. scorch earth on the sun burns up earth, earthquakes tsunamis, will come on the earth and you be a hellish time to those left behind. an people who take the mark with have the worst punishing in the tribulation. At the end of the 7 year tribulation jesus turns to earth with is saints not during the tribultaion. Jesus on his white horse wearing a white robes with garment in red saying lord of lords, king of kings and his saints (us christian who died and raptured) will charge and defeat Lucifer, his followers and unbelievers and he will be cast back to the pit and Jesus will rule us for 1000 year. then Lucifer will try again and god will stop him for good and he and his follower and people who are not in the lambs book will be cast into lake of fire/second death. then the new Jerusalem, earth, and heaven will come and god will dwell in us forever with no sin, pain, evil, suffer are all gone. if you get behund do not faer, cry or be dismay. you can still be save just have to martyer for christ. you die but it be quick an temproaly pain. the wars are getining intense an soon ww3 wil be apond us an thr anti-christ. spread the word",

It implies that anyone belonging to that religion is entitled to citizenship in that state, even if they weren‚Äôt born there. Following this, Jews‚Äîincluding many from war-torn regions‚Äîbegan migrating to Palestine, settling and expanding across Palestinian lands, often through forceful means.\n\nNaturally, Palestinians resisted this encroachment, but Western governments, unfortunately, supported the settlers. At the time, Britain controlled the Palestinian territories and made this promise to the Jewish community, effectively handing over land from one occupying power to another. This marked the beginning of the ongoing conflict and suffering in the region.\n\nFree Palestine üáµüá∏üáøüá¶ \nMuch Love from south Africa üáøüá¶",

    "text": "This is how we should each pray to God our true Father in heaven and on earth: ‚Äì ‚Äúwhen you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you openly. In your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. Do not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him.\r\nThis is how you should pray:\r\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\r\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\r\nGive us today our daily bread,\r\nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\r\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one.\r\nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever.\r\nAmen.\r\nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.‚Äù ‚Äì (The Prophet and Messiah Jesus of Nazareth at Matthew 6: 6-15) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúPass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.‚Äù ‚Äì (at Matthew 7: 1-2) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúIn truth I tell you, if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.‚Äù ‚Äì (at John 8: 51) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAlways treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\r\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 12-14) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\r\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 10: 9-10) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúBeware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves. You will recognize them by the fruits they bear.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 15-16) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 21) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúI am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and any one who is alive and has faith shall never die.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 11: 25-26) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI have not come to judge the world, but to save the world‚Äù ‚Äì (John 12: 47) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúWhoever then will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 10: 32-34) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 14: 6-7) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAn expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‚ÄòTeacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?‚Äô He answered, ‚ÄòLove the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. Everything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 22: 35-40) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThere is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 15: 13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúDo not call any man on earth ‚Äòfather‚Äô ; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‚Äòteacher‚Äô ; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 23: 9-10) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTake care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 4) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúMany false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men‚Äôs love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. ‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 11-13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTeach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And be assured, I am with you always, to the end of time.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 28: 20) ‚Äì\r\n\r\nYours, in true Spirit and in our one given prayer, 2gointruth, on Sunday the 17th of November 2024: ‚Äì (Please read Matthew 5: 14-16) ‚Äì Where every minute (of both day and night) can be a new beginning for any one of us. Let it always be you. Pray to God often, as prescribed above, before it is too late.",

Indeed, Hisbolla made a huge mistake when it started a war unnecessarily with a formidable military power like Israel, solely at Iran's instigation. No one can influence Israel to stop the bombing. If the situation goes on like this, the deaths and suffering will only increase. The media, including Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN, etc, reporting such misery and counting deaths will not help the Hisbolla or their shelterers in Lebanon. Encourage and pressure Hisbolla to surrender as soon as possible and swear in the name of God in a manner that convinces Israel that they will never repeat their errors again. That is the only way to reduce the suffering in Lebanon.",

    "text": "I‚Äôm no fan of Saudi Arabia not the slightest but last I checked Saudi Arabia didn‚Äôt do any of those things in Gaza did I miss something?  Not Israel defending themselves, but you‚Äôre looking at another nation that had nothing to do with attack on October 7 or the response Israel had afterwards and you‚Äôre asking them could you have done something different?  They literally had nothing to do with this. You should be asking the major players involved could you have done something different. You should be asking Israel could you have done something different. In fact, I‚Äôm sure Israel is asking themselves as a nation could they have done something different. While those attacks were tragic, truly tragic Israel has to ask a very tough question. Someone should have been ready October 7 to defend the nation and they weren‚Äôt. You need to know why because died as a result. That is just a mistake that isn‚Äôt just a small error. Entire portion of the country should‚Äôve been defended and it wasn‚Äôt, heads roll people should be in jail for this, not on the attacker side necessarily, although they definitely deserve punishment but on the defensive side, somebody screwed up the question is who?  . Now I‚Äôll be honest the people on the Israeli side who screwed up they don‚Äôt want to say anything because they really messed up. They would rather focus on war and going after enemies and perceived enemies rather than figuring out who dropped the ball here. I‚Äôll admit their Prime Minister. He dropped the ball, you let another entity not another country just another entity with low military force invade and they were there for hours. Are you kidding me? You need to be fired should‚Äôve been military personnel getting this under control immediately, but it was as if everybody was on vacation. I‚Äôll be honest it almost gives credence to a crazy conspiracy theory that let it happen on purpose because this never should‚Äôve happened. How bad it is what happened October 7 and Israel anybody with a brain goes how did you let this happen. You were supposed to be there it‚Äôs literally like falling asleep at the wheel and letting the car crash into TNT exploded. I give no credence none whatsoever to the killers on October 7. They deserve to be hunted down, but I have supposed to ask the tough questions of the Israeli military. What the hell happened that day your military just wasn‚Äôt there was everybody on vacation\n\nDon‚Äôt show up and ask these other nations could they have done something differently? I‚Äôm asking the nation of Israel. Could you have done something differently at the very start you know before the terrorist were at your doorstep shouldn‚Äôt you have a better defense defense. I understand you have a superior army now , their military force and capability, but I have to go back to the question. Where were you if someone did it before can some other group do it again? I bet they‚Äôre going to say no we‚Äôre ready this time but I don‚Äôt believe you because of what happened unbelievable I can‚Äôt take you at your word going forward.",

Israelis have been trying to steal land from the Lebanese for many years, they think nothing of murdering them. Why do you think hezbollah and Hamas existed in the first place.\n\nPlease support all the pro Palestine Lebanese high profile individuals. \n\nOur governments are arresting  humanitarian pro Palestinian activists, protesters by misusing our terror laws.

    "text": "The comments here illustrate a blatant lack of knowledge of the historical context of the region and the idea that the Arab side has initiated and instigated every war since 1948. In 1948, the Palestinians and Israelis were given the partition plan and the Israelis agreed to it and the Palestinians did not. They could have been a country but they have illustrated to the world that they do not deserve to become one. Becoming a country is something that is earned and not a right given the violent behaviors since 1948--the 1948 war, yom kippur war, 1967 war, Lebanese civil war, first and second intifada, and Black September in Jordan not to mention this current war. Israel is not only defending itself but also ridding the Middle East of unecessary evil in the guise of subsets of the Muslim brotherhood--Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis etc. Shame on Lebanon for allowing them to come into their country. The rest of the Muslim/Arab world is afraid to revolt and fight back and they let Israel do their dirty work. There are 52 Muslim majority countries in the world today and they keep saying Israel is occupied, but Jordan/Turkey/Morocco/Libya/Tunisia/Egypt/Lebanon used to be Christian countries. Afghanistan and Pakistan were zorastrian, Hindu, and Buddhist. So Muslim majority countries, where are your Jews, Yzidi's, Druze, Christians, Hindus, and Buddhists? \n\nOh wait--you either kicked them out or killed them. Look up the Lebanese civil war, the revolution of 1952 in Egypt, the Farhud in Iraq, the Iranian Revolution of 1979. These are where you kicked the Jews out of Muslim majority countries as they helped grow your countries and ran banks since it is against Islam and this is how you repay them. Israel isn't perfect by any means and every Palestinian and Israeli life matters, but if you keep killing and fight against a country that has a GDP higher than any other country in the middle east other than the UAE and may Qatar because of oil money--this is what you get folks!! The truths and history don't lie.",

    "text": "First of all the Saudis were in the process of normalizing relations with Israel before Oct. 7, with no Palestinian statehood on the horizon. Not entirely sure why the Saudis decided to now play the game of pretending to care about Gazans. Whatever the situation is going to be with Palestinians after the war is over, the Saudis will be good boys and will normalize relations with Israel anyway, for one, because they'll need to make sure that their common enemy, the current Iranian regime, doesn't find its way back to the throne.  \nSecond, a lot of the info he is providing is factually wrong. There is a massive amount of humanitarian help pouring into Gaza in the form of food, and medicine.",

I suggest them to rethink what they do for Palestinians - they enable terrorist actions and they do not accept refugees.",

Yes, the beginning was 1948 but even if you start at 1976 boarders with West Bank, Gaza, and east Jerusalem as Palestinian Territories (since they are not Israeli territories). This crime has always been in process of being committed brutally and slowly against all international law and against all american law. Why does Israel get a pass for this. \nWhen asking \"how should Israel have acted after oct 7th?\"  it would be the same as asking store owner who is being robbed, how the criminal should have acted properly when the store owner calls the police or starts to yell at the criminals to leave his store that they are trying to rob. Does Piers want Palestinians to agree that the criminal had a right to kill them or threaten them if they dared to call the police while their store was being robbed. Is calling the police a step too far for the owner that is being robbed.  I just don't understand the logic.",

    "text": "... üî¥¬†QUESTION: Will there be a second chance for salvation after death? \n****************\nüî¥ Dear people, don't waste your life! Your sins can be forgiven surely by the Lord Jesus Christ! Repent and believe the Gospel! This is your salvation and there is no other.\n\nüî¥ The LORD JESUS Christ spoke about His return in the generation that will see the people of Israel back to their land. We are the ones who see this prophecy fulfilled.\n\nüî¥¬†ANSWER: While the idea of a second chance for salvation is appealing, the Bible is clear that death is the end of all chances. Hebrews 9:27 tells us that we die, and then face judgment. So, as long as a person is alive, he has a second, third, fourth, fifth, etc. chance to accept Lord Jesus Christ and be saved (John 3:16; Romans 10:9-10; Acts 16:31). Once a person dies, there are no more chances.¬†\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n‚óè¬†Hebrews 9\n27. And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:\n28. So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nüî¥ The Apostle John when he saw the Lord Jesus Christ in Heaven:\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n‚óè¬†Revelation 1\n17. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I Am the First and the Last:\n18. I Am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I Am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the KEYS of Hell and of death.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nüî¥¬†If ever someone should have repented when given a second chance to see¬†clearly the truth, it was the rich man. But although he was in torment in fire, he only asked that Abraham send Lazarus back to earth to warn his brothers so they didn‚Äôt have to suffer the same fate.  In him there was no power to repent because there was no presence of the Holy Spirit in his heart.\nThe Holy Spirit works only in the hearts of people who are alive on earth. Was pain and regret for where he found himself. \nAbraham‚Äôs answer says it all: ‚ÄúAnd he said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded, even though one rose from the dead‚Äù (Luke 16:31). Here we see that the witness of the Scriptures is sufficient for salvation for those who believe it, and no other revelation will bring about salvation to those who do not. No second, third, or fourth chances would be enough to turn the heart of stone into a heart of flesh.\n\nüî¥¬†What about those who do not believe? Wouldn‚Äôt they repent and believe if they were given a second chance? The answer is no, they would not because their hearts are not changed simply because they die. Their hearts and minds ‚Äúare at enmity‚Äù against God and won‚Äôt accept Him even when they see reality of Heaven. This is evidenced clearly in the story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16:19-31.\n\nüî¥ Moreover and of big importance against the deceptive teachings of Satan who deceives people by those he possesses: Abraham tells the rich man that it is impossible for anyone there to come to Heaven from the torments of fire or vice versa. (Luke 16:26)\nIf someone is in the home of the dead, in torment, waiting for judgment, will not enter to Heaven! It's impossible!\nIf someone tells you otherwise is deceiver. \n\nüî¥¬†To understand what happens to nonbelievers after they die, we go to Revelation 20:11-15 which describes the Great White Throne judgment and the Lord Jesus is the Judge of mankind John 5:22 \"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son\".¬†\n\nüî¥¬†Here takes place the opening of the books and ‚Äúthe dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.‚Äù The books contain all the thoughts and deeds of those being judged, and we know from Romans 3:20 that ‚Äúby the works of the Law is no flesh justified.‚Äù Therefore, all who are judged by their works and thoughts are condemned to Hell. Believers in Christ, on the other hand, are not judged by the books of works, but their names are found written in another book: the ‚ÄúLamb‚Äôs Book of Life‚Äù (Revelation 21:27). These are the ones who have believed on the Lord Jesus, and they alone will be allowed to enter heaven.\n\nüî¥¬†The key to understanding this is the Lamb‚Äôs Book of Life. Anyone whose name is written in this book was ‚Äúsaved before the foundation of the world‚Äù (Ephesians 1:4) by God‚Äôs sovereign saving grace to be part of His Son‚Äôs bride, the church of Jesus Christ. These people need no ‚Äúsecond chance‚Äù at salvation because their salvation has been secured by Christ. He chose us, He saved us, and He will keep us saved. Nothing can separate us from Christ (Romans 8:39). Those for whom He died will be saved because Lord Jesus will see to it. He declared ‚Äúall that the Father has given Me will come to Me‚Äù (John 6:37), and ‚ÄúI give to them eternal life, and they shall never ever perish, and not anyone shall pluck them out of My hand‚Äù (John 10:28). For believers, there is no need for a second chance because the first chance is sufficient.\n\nüî¥¬†In Philippians 2:10-11 we have this testimony: ‚ÄúThat at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.‚Äù One day, everyone will bow before Lord Jesus and recognize that He is The Lord and The Savior. At that point, though, it will be too late for salvation. After death, all that remains for the unbeliever is judgment and damnation in Hell fire for eternity (Matthew 25:41, Mark 9: 43-44, 2-Peter 3:7, Revelation 20:14-15, Revelation 21:8).¬†\n\nThat is why we must trust in Lord Jesus Christ in this life. That is why we must follow the Lord Jesus Christ!\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n‚óè Matthew 4\n17. From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n‚óè Matthew 28¬†\n19. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:\n20. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I Am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n‚óè Mark 6\n12. And they went out, and preached that men should repent.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n‚óè Acts 2\n38. Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.",

Attack that occurred on October 7th was definitely cheered by the Palestinians in Gaza. I am not saying this to demonize the people in Gaza.  I believe that Hamas used the people in Gaza as martyrs. They knew that the Israeli response to having almost 1500 women and children slaughtered would be horrific. Any country response to such horrible carnage would be Close to what Israel is doing now. I think Israel should have did a better job of trying to avoid civilian injuries but at one time there were 500 hostages. The people of Gaza had to have known where these hostages were and participated in watching them or feeding them or moving them. There needs to be an unconditional surrender of Hamas return the hostages and stop this war",

    "text": "This headline, like so many others, presents Israeli military operations as justifiable, sanitized \"moments\" of warfare, while ignoring the broader reality of occupation, military oppression, and the devastating impact on Palestinian civilians. Yes, this video shows the precision of an Israeli tank firing on a building allegedly associated with Yahya Sinwar, but it also reflects the ongoing siege of Gaza, where over 2 million Palestinians live under brutal blockade and constant bombardment.\n\nThe Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) consistently frame these strikes as \"targeting terrorists,\" yet the human toll of these operations is immense, with countless civilians killed, homes destroyed, and entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble. By focusing on the spectacle of military precision, this video obscures the violence of occupation and the systematic oppression of Palestinians who have been living under Israeli control for decades.\n\nThe real question is: What is the purpose of showing these videos? They seem to serve as propaganda, justifying Israel‚Äôs actions while diverting attention from the root cause of the conflict‚ÄîIsrael‚Äôs illegal occupation, blockade, and apartheid system that fuels resistance.\n\nThis kind of militarized \"show of force\" is not a solution but a symptom of the larger problem: ongoing occupation, colonial control over Palestinian lands, and the imperialistic domination of the region. Instead of glorifying tank strikes, the focus should be on ending the occupation, dismantling the structures of apartheid, and working towards justice and liberation for the Palestinian people.",

There is not a single constructive bone in the pathetic Palestinianism concept. Their one thing is the destruction of the Jewish state. Palestinians are the only people to be offered statehood with borders 4 times in 1937, 1947, 2000 and 2008 (two offers before there was one refugee and twice by Israel), to which they refused each time. For reference, Kurds or Tibetan were never given a single offer.\n\nIsrael must continue the war until the Gazans understand that their Palestinianism is a false narrative. Including the name Palestinian whose origin is \"invader\" in Hebrew (from 3000 years ago ). This anecdote alone is to show how pathetic are the brainwashed pseudo-journalists of the Broadcast of Bolsheviks and Communists (BBC), Communist News Network (CNN), and Media for Socialism News of Bolsheviks and Communists (MS-NBC).",

Jews hold a special place of contempt and hatred for devout Muslims, it's actually a tenet in their \"holy\" book the Koran to kill Jews \"wherever you find them.\" All this talk of co-exstence or two state solutions is a sham because the \"Palestinians\" who are really just Arabs, and also Muslims, will never accept being  ruled over or even living side by side with Jews. They will not stop until all Jews are expelled and/ or killed.  It is an awful predicament that Israel is on, they are damned if they do or damned if they don't. What is happening now is a tragedy, but this is exactly what Hamas was hoping for. All the dead and wounded Palestinians are now shaheeds, or martyrs for Islam and Palestine. The entire Islamic world is besides itself with anger (if it's even possible to make them even angrier than usual). There are 1.4 billion Muslims in the world, and growing all the time. They are tightening the noose around Israel, and it will truly be a miracle if Israel survives. If they destroy Israel, then they are coming to a town near you.",

    "text": "The earlier the Palestinians give up the delusion of removing Israel from the land of their ancestors, the better. They should stop pumping hate into their youths, but invest in educating them. They should stop digging tunnels and start building industries, businesses, institutions of learning, sustainable agriculture, alternative energy sources, etc. \n\nThey can turn Palestine into a haven instead of trying to grab the land of Israel. How many Palestinians have to die since the 1960s? If you build your land, you can come to the table of negotiation as equals, and diplomacy may achieve what terrorism cannot and will not (at least, experience has proven that).\n\nMany are saying more Sinwars will arise...sadly, on the other hand, more Netanyahus too will arise to take them out. It is blood in blood out...but many bright youths on both sides are dying.\n\nOf those Palestinian youths turned to hate-filled terrorists on a delusional ideology of driving the Jews into the river or sea, many could have been great scientists, astronauts, inventors, IT gurus, agricultural technologists, etc., and they would have done great good for their families and their nation.\n\nI feel sad that a fantasy-ideology is turning many mothers childless and ruining the lives of young men while they are erroneously called martyrs.\n\nHow many more have to die?",
