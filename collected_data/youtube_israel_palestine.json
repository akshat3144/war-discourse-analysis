    "text": "4.\n\n1. We must remember that Elon Musk's satellite was seen in the sky of India when we were told in the news that Elon Musk launches his satellite into every year space. I had not seen it before, maybe you people also have never seen it. A little before that Corona had also come and the trial of 5G in our India also happened at the same time.\n\n2. Corona virus did not come from China, this brain chip was tested all over the world through Elon Musk's satellite which is still installed above the sky of India, which looks like a star.\n\n3. Now I want to tell the whole world that how Elon Musk's satellite and its laser weapons which look like stars are flying in the sky without any fuel. We must have heard about wireless charging which is available in cars these days which charges the phone without any wire. Electromagnetic current comes out of it which charges the phone and the 5G phone towers installed in our India also emit electromagnetic current. This electromagnetic current charges these satellites and laser weapons in the same way as a phone is charged by wireless charging. In this way, these satellites are flying in the sky without any fuel.\n\n4. I want to tell our Indian Government, the people of the country and the governments of other countries that any secret document related to the security of the country should not be saved in any electronic device, it should be kept on paper because the system of the entire world is hacked through Elon Musk's satellite.\n\n5. If we share our private moments with our family in these satellites of Elon Musk, then these satellites also know about it.\n\n6. Our country's senior lawyer Kapil Sibal has also said that Pegasus software is being used but he could not prove it in the court. I have told about this Pegasus software in my letter.\n\n7. Till now I have given this letter to the President, Prime Minister, Defense Ministry and Home Ministry but till now I have not received any reply from any department.\n\n8. We will remember that the USA government had dropped atomic bomb on japan on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, then the coming generation had to face many diseases when the government of any country did not say anything to the USA government about this. That's why japan is taking its revenge on the whole world today.\n\n9. I want to tel my country people to share this as much as possible so that this letter reaches the whole world.\n\nGAURAV ARORA\n\nAdd: H.

    "text": "I and my entire family have been attacked by Havana Syndrome for the last 5 years. It is a biological weapon. Even the USA government has not been able to figure it out. I know, these are small nano particles, silver particles, gold particles, These are installed in the human brain through the human's eyes, ears, and nose. These particles work as radio frequencies, which we might have seen on phone towers around our house, when their frequency was increased. If this happens, the human brain stops working up to 90 percent. Elon Musk secretly said that I will make such a chip which will control the human mind. That chip has been installed in the minds of 99 percent people in India. I want to tell about my coutry people my country is also being attacked with Havana syndrome. This is a biological weapon and our country's army officers, RAW agency, CBI, NIA, doctors, judges, politicians, lawyers, Scientist, businessmen, journalists, police, actors etc. And the people of our country are also victims. My request to my country people and to the Government of India is to save India, otherwise the coming generations will be forced to live a life of slavery. I can prove this to my country people. To save India from being a slave..\n\n1. Robot technology is being used on us Indians through these towers. And Satellite\n\n2. One thing is very important. The entire climate of India has been created artificially. Sun, moon, stars, clouds, all this is artificial.\n\n3. I have been looking for a long time. Many airplanes are flying over our India. Electronic waves emerge in these Airplanes. I have been watching all this since the Corona period.\n\n4. The first case of Hawana syndrome has been registered in Karnataka High Court. Karnataka High Court has ordered the Central Government to investigate within 3 months.\n\n5. Sushant Singh Rajput was killed because he had land on the moon. Since the moon is artificial, he was also killed.\n\n6. Two of our Indian scientists were making an engine that would fly in the sky without fuel. Their lab also caught fire and both of\n\nthem were killed.\n\n7. I have complete information about Illuminati group and how this group works.\n\n8. Nowadays we are seeing that the lights on which earlier there was a challan, today remain on in scooters, bikes and cars.\n\n9. Has Elon Musk's satellite been placed over Indian skies to spy on India?\n\n10. What we call pollution in Delhi is not pollution but poisonous bio gases.\n\n11. Nano robots have been inserted into our bodies.\n\n12. I can prove that the Third World War has started in India. And this war is being fought with biological weapons, virus biogases. 13. What I am writing in this letter. If I cannot prove even a single thing then I will accept whatever punishment the government gives.\n\nGAURAV ARORA\n\nADD.: H.

    "text": "1. I Gaurav Arora had promised my countrymen and other countries that I will soon reveal the names of those traitors to the whole world. Their names are-PM Narendra Modi, NSA Ajit Doval and their supporters Elon Musk, China, Israel and Japan.\n\n2. PM Narendra Modi ji, you did not even spare our tricolor flag which you have installed in Delhi and other states of India and the poles on which our national tricolor is installed. These poles are also a part of these biological weapons, satellites and laser weapons. Modi ji, if you loved our national tricolor so much then why did you not install it at your home. It is the misfortune of our country India that our India got a Prime Minister like PM Narendra Modi.\n\n3. Our india's PM Narendra Modi ji, NSA Ajit Doval, Elon Musk, Israel, China and Japan all together have ruined our India. And they will also ruin America, Russia and other countries. I have evidence against these people. I want to tell America, Russia and other countries to send a delegation to India and I will give you evidence against them.\n\n4. America's Vice President Jed Wax's wife is an agent supported by Narendra Modi and NSA Ajit Doval. Our RAW, CBI, NIA has no role in this because these people have destroyed our RAW, CBI, NIA. Because now this satellite is doing the work of RAW, CBI, NIA. Only one name is going around that India's RAW, CBI, NIA are agencies.\n\n5. Now the names of those companies and their owners have to be disclosed from where all this is going on.\n\n6. I Gaurav Arora want to ask the US government that why no action has been taken against Elon Musk till now?\n\n7. I want to tell one thing to my countrymen that we use Paytm, Google Pay and PhonePe. This is a message that I made you send and you made the shopkeeper send it to the salesman and we took the goods that we wanted and then again we do the same thing and are giving our goods for free. You people should use your brain a little and the money that we have in our banks, with this money these people are using biological weapons and viruses on us because it takes a lot of money to use these biological weapons. There is a saying in our India, our head and our shoes. So please stop this PhonePe, Paytm, GooglePay and work in cash as much as possible.\n\n8. In our India, phone towers are being used as biological weapons. I will also tell you how? They will rent the house next to yours and install the phone tower machine towards your house. Then the electronic magnetic waves coming out of it will kill you and your family very easily, just like it happened with my family. You will not even know what happened to your family. And one more thing, when I went to the house of our country's Air Chief Marshal Mr. A P Singh ji with my letter, there the phone tower is installed right at the gate of his house. The height of that tower would be about 5 feet.\n\n9. Narendra Modi ji, you have set up a nano chip factory in Gujarat, what will be the use of this chip. You did not tell me whether this factory is the same one whose particles I have talked about in my letter, which have been released in the atmosphere of our India. Such a company is also in our Okhla Phase-1. Narendra Modi ji, very soon I will make a big disclosure, you just wait a little.\n\n10. As our country's PM Narendra Modi Ji had told us Indians that the presidents of 20 countries had come to the G-20 meeting. The names of those countries were Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea and Turkey. This meeting was held in the United Kingdom and the United States Bharat Mandapam. Let me tell you one more thing, where are these particles coming from in the underpasses built near Bharat Mandapam and the Supreme Court. I have mentioned about the particles in my letter. It is also possible that Bharat Mandapam is now being used in some other way. Like our national tricolor flag was used by our country's Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji,\n\n11. One very important thing, these particles are present inside the Parliament building of our country India. You people can check it.\n\n12. We have 5G towers in India. These are being used as biological weapons. Electronic magnetic waves emanate from these. We Indians are being given slow motion poison to weaken our brains. All of them are doing this with other countries as well. PM Narendra Modi will have to answer.\n\n13. The particles I have talked about in my letter. These particles work in a chain. These particles are so powerful that they can jam the entire system of a flying airplane and crush it.\n\n14. For 75 years no one raised their eyes towards our Jeevan Jawan Jyoti and Narendra Modi ji, you got our Jeevan Jawan Jyoti removed from India Gate and placed it on the other side, why? And our India remained silent and the war that happened between India and Pakistan, you people named that operation Sindoor. Then you say send Sindoor to every house. Don't our mothers and sisters have husbands that Narendra Modi ji will send Sindoor? Narendra Modi ji, you said such obscene things. Still the people of our India remained silent. This country India does not belong to any one person. Narendra Modi ji, I will say again that it is the misfortune of our country India that we Indians got a Prime Minister like Narendra Modi.\n\n15. Narendra Modi ji and Ajit Doval ji, remember the day when you people took oath that we will sacrifice our lives for the country. Remember that moment, and one more thing, the stick of the Almighty does not make any sound, but when it falls, even the best of men become straight.\n\n16. PM Narendra Modi ji, you people have killed lakhs of people in India in the name of Corona. You have killed people from other countries too. You will have to answer for this too because the law is same for everyone. And one more thing. I will take all these things to the International Court of Justice. If my countrymen and other countries support me then.\n\n17. I want to tell all the countries that in our India, lakhs of people have been killed in the name of Corona. There was no place to cremate the bodies in the crematoriums of our country. Now you people can think for yourself what people did to us. I will tell you again that this was the testing of brain chip.\n\n18. The 5G phone towers in India are also being used as biological weapons. To weaken the brains of Indians, we Indians are being given slow motion poison. And all of them are doing this with other countries as well. PM Narendra Modi will have to answer.\n\n19. In our India, phone towers are being used as biological weapons. I will also tell you how.? We will rent the house next to yours and install the phone tower machine towards your house. Then the electronic magnetic waves coming out of it will kill you and your family easily, just like it killed my family. And you will not even know what happened to your family. And one more thing, when I went to the house of our country's Air Chief Marshal Mr. A P Singh ji with my letter, there the phone tower is installed at the gate of his house, the height of that tower must be 5 feet.\n\n20. As we were told earlier that the Canadian government did not invite PM Narendra Modi to the G-7 meeting. Later we were told that the Canadian government has invited PM Narendra Modi to the G-7 meeting. PM Narendra Modi told this when I went to Canada, US President Donald Trump told me that since you have come to Canada, we should go via America and have lunch together. But Narendra Modi rejected his proposal. After that we were told that the war between Israel and iran has started. President Donald Trump has left the G-7 meeting and gone from Canada.",

First name is America Embassy, ‚Äã‚ÄãAustralia, Russia British Afghanistan, Netherlands Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia Iran, Canada, Georgia, Cuba Fas, Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka Germany, Vietnam and Poland, in these embassies the number of particles is very high.\n\n14. Havana Syndrome, which is a biological weapon. I have mentioned about this in my letter that some very powerful people of our country India are also included in this. Their names are Mr. Narendra Modi, Elon Musk, China, Israel, Japan and Ajit Doval. And one more thing, the 50% tariff that US President Mr. Donald Trump has imposed on India, this tariff has not been imposed on India but on us Indians through Mr. Narendra Modi. Narendra Modi, Ajit Doval, Elon Musk, Israel, China and Japan, all of them together have used Havana Syndrome virus and biological weapons on America, Russia, Canada, Australia, Georgia, Germany, Colombia, India, Poland, Taiwan, Cuba and Canada since 2016. And this tariff which is being imposed on us Indians is because of this. One thing is that when there was a war between India and Pakistan, no country supported us, this was the reason and the second reason was that they have created a fake climate of our India in collaboration with China. If there was a war, then these people would have had to remove this entire fake climate. Third reason is when our country's PM Narendra Modi is giving weapons to Israel to fight, so if our country's weapons fell short during the war, what would we Indians have answered? I think you all must have understood what I said and as far as I think General Bipin Singh Rawat knew all these things, before he could tell anyone about these things, his helicopter was crashed through artificial clouds. Narendra Modi ji, you will have to answer for these things.",

    "text": "1. I Gaurav Arora, with folded hands pray to the government that biological weapons and viruses are being used on us Indians, we Indians should be helped and whichever country will help us Indians, I will give such information to that country which will be known to Elon Musk, Japan, China, Israel and very powerful people of our country India and no other country will know about this.\n\n2. 1, Gaurav Arora, request the Ambassador of the Embassy with folded hands that this letter of mine should be shared with America, Russia and other countries. As far as I think, this letter of mine is not reaching the Ambassador of the foreign country's Embassy in Delhi.\n\n3. I Gaurav Arora want to tell the mothers and sisters of my country India that stop keeping fasts of Karwa Chauth and Chhath Puja and also stop offering water to the Sun God in the morning. And I want to tell my Muslim brothers that you people should also stop celebrating Eid by looking at the moon because our country's PM Shri Narendra Modi ji has installed fake moon and sun in our India in connivance with China and China has occupied our Indian land Arunachal Pradesh for this reason. Today I want to tell you one more thing that the first ray of the Sun God that falls in our India falls in Arunachal Pradesh. Now you people must have understood that our country's PM Narendra Modi ji has traded India's role with China. I want to tell Narendra Modi ji that we Indians will have to answer this. I am ready to do a live interview with our country's Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji. If my statement turns out to be wrong, then even the death penalty is acceptable.\n\n4. Our country's PM Narendra Modi has installed satellites all over India in collaboration with China, Israel, Elon Musk and Japan. Don't these satellites know where the terrorists went after killing our innocent countrymen? I want to tell our country's Prime Minister Narendra Modi that you will have to answer these questions.\n\n5. 1, Gaurav Arora, have talked about these particles in my letter. These particles will be injected into the veins of our body through medicine and as far as I think, all this has already started and Elon Musk's satellite is installed in India. It will be installed in your country as well and then it will be told that internet will be available through it, but I want to tell you that internet will not be available through it. Just like the brains of us Indians are being controlled, similarly your brains will be controlled through Elon Musk's satellite. This satellite looks like a star.\n\n6. When our country's PM Shri Narendra Modi knew that Corona vaccine was causing heart attacks, then why was it not banned and why was the Corona vaccine sent to other countries?\n\n7. Elon Musk had tested the brain chip on 21 monkeys and kept them under his surveillance for 24 hours, out of which 15 monkeys died. The same thing happened with us. We were also imprisoned in our homes in the name of corona.\n\n8. The moon which I have described as artificial, which rises in our India. It is a satellite. It has been designed in such a way that we Indians cannot doubt it, and through this our mind is being controlled. If I am wrong then our country's Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi can see it through a telescope.\n\n9. The airplanes and drones that are being flown in our India and Delhi have laser weapons installed in them and these laser weapons are being used on us Indians.\n\n10. I Gaurav Arora want to ask one more question to our country's Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi that whether our India's Surya Yan will go to the real Sun or the fake one because the Sun that rises in our India is fake, I can prove this also in 15 seconds.\n\n11. As I have mentioned about the particles, satellites and laser weapons in my letter, there is neither any satellite nor any particle nor any laser weapon near the house of our country's PM Shri Narendra Modi Ji.\n\n12. I want to ask our country's PM Shri Narendra Modi Ji and our country's NSA National Security Advisor Mr. Ajit Doval Ji that how did such a big activity happen inside India that I have written in my letter. How should I look at all these things. It is not possible that such a big activity is happening in our India and you people are not aware of it.\n\n13. When I gave my letter to our Indian Army soldiers, our India Army soldiers told me. When we do yoga in the morning, we hear the sound of a whistle and a machine running in our ears. When that traitor did not spare even our army soldiers, then you people can think for yourselves.\n\n14. G20 network is being used to control the minds of us Indians. Full form of G20 is G > Ground, 2 >To, 0> Ground network.\n\n15. I want to tell you again that China, Israel, Japan, Elon Musk and a very powerful person of our country India, all of them are together.\n\n16. Has any country ever thought that how a person who made a battery car became the richest man in the world. Whose name is Elon Musk. If even a 12 year old child can make a battery car then why can't he become the richest man in the world. Elon Musk has been made rich. You people are also wise ahead.\n\n17. I Gaurav Arora want to tell the traitor of our India that I am neither afraid of you nor of your intelligence, the God has given me a pen in my hand, as long as I write, I will write the truth.",

I want to tell my countrymen a very important thing that right now i am doing an investigation. if i come to know that any person from our country india is involved behind all these things, then i will expose him in front of the world very soon, no matter how powerful he is.\n\n20 now you must be thinking, that i collected so much information for my country india, but why these people could not kill me till now. i just want to say that these people have done something with me and my family which no one has ever heard or seen. just understand that tears must have come in the eyes of the god. and till now all this is still happening with me and my family. if ever such an opportunity comes, I will definitely share this thing with my countrymen.\n\n21 i am gaurav arora, what i have written in my letter. my indian government can arrange a live interview of me. i will prove all these things within 1 hour, otherwise i will accept whatever punishment my indian government gives me.\n\n22 as we all indians will remember that our country india's prime minister narendra modi ji had said. every home tricolor, similarly we all indians have to send this letter to every home and every country. I gaurav arora with folded hands pray to my countrymen that now i will need your support\n\n23 Today I want to tell one thing to my countrymen and countrymen living in other countries that according to the International Court of Justice, neither can anyone use any biological weapon or virus on any country nor can any country use biological weapon or virus on the people of its country, but biological weapons and viruses are being used on us Indians.\n\n24 If a diplomat of any country or anyone living in that country is being made a victim of Havana syndrome, then I will cure that person and will also tell how to avoid it. I will also tell why it is being used on us?\n\n25 Havana syndrome is a biological weapon made by Elon Musk China and some very powerful person of our country India is involved in all these things. Most of the cases of Havana syndrome are in India but these things are not being shown.\n\n26 As I have mentioned in my letter about nano particles, silver particles, golden particles and Ebola virus that these are present at Indira Gandhi Airport as well, then these particles must be going to other states of India and other countries through drones and ships.\n\n27 The particles which I have talked about in my letter, these particles are also present in the embassies of foreign countries in Delhi.\n\n28 The airplanes and drones that I have mentioned in my letters emit such a loud sound that even a fighter jet does not emit such a loud sound. Because of this, the eardrums of both my ears have been damaged.\n\n29 All these things that I have written in my letter, as far as I think, this must be happening with other countries as well. So you people should also check all these things in your country.\n\n30 Till now my Indian Government has not taken any action on what I have written in my letter, therefore I have not been able to do anything for my country India. But if any country needs me, then I will always be ready to help that country. Because just like our India, there are humans living in other countries too. If you look at the head, ears and face of any country or person who is being attacked by Havana Syndrome through a magnifying glass, you will find these particles stuck to it.\n\n31 As it is being shown in our Indian news channels that it has been 1400 days since the war between Russia and Ukraine. This war is being organized by the USA and Russia to make the two super powers fight each other. There is a very strong planning behind this. Some countries feel that now they should also become super powers because the whole world knows that if there is a war between Russia and the USA, then this war will continue until these two countries destroy each other and when both the countries become weak while fighting. After that those countries will attack the USA and Russia, at that time the USA and Russia will not be able to do anything, and you people will have to accept defeat from\n\nthat country. I pray to God that there should never be a war between the USA and Russia. 32 The brains of us Indians are being controlled through Elon Musk's satellite\n\n33 Gaurav Arora, want to ask one more question to our country's Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. When our country's Suryayan goes to the Sun, will it go to the real Sun or the fake one? Because the Sun that rises in our India is fake. I can prove this in 15 seconds.",

He has made a brain chip and has made a star-like satellite and a star-like laser weapon which has been installed in India.\n\n2. China: He has created an artificial climate in India and has installed artificial sun and moon in India.\n\n3. Israel: He is using Pegasus software on the Indian government and the people of the country. The drones that I have mentioned in my letter belong to Israel.\n\n4. The Illuminati group I mentioned in my letter is a Japan agency.\n\n5\n\n. Elon Musk currently lives in the USA but I want to tell you that the USA government has no hand in this.\n\n6. China, Israel, Elon Musk and Japan want to take over the entire earth. Elon Musk is a dedicated agent of Japan.\n\n7. I request my country's government and the government of other countries to take some action for this as soon as possible.\n\n8. Our country's army and the people of our country are producing test tube babies. The land of India which gave birth to brave warriors is now producing babies through test tube babies. I don't think there will be any worse days than this for our India.\n\n9.\n\nVery soon I will expose the truth of the Corona virus before the whole world.\n\n10. You can hear the sound of the particles I have talked about in my letters by closing your ears with the fingers of your hands.\n\n11. 11. I want to tell the entire world that ever since I wrote in my letter that I will soon reveal the truth about Corona, since then the laser weapons that I mentioned in my letters, which earlier used to be installed 400 to 500 feet above my house, have now been increased to 100 to 150 feet, I am having a lot of trouble breathing, my hair is falling out, my muscles are getting stiff and my head is vibrating. My memory is weakening and it feels as if something heavy is hitting my head.\n\n12. That I have talked about in my letters about laser weapons and Starlink satellites which look like a star, are installed above the Chanakyapuri Embassy and above the houses of top judges of our country.\n\n13. Even now these drones which look like airplanes are flown so low that our Indian radars are not able to detect them and still they are flying over the skies of India.\n\n14. I thank Aaj Tak news channel Shams Tahir Khan and the entire Crime Tak team from the bottom of my heart that they showed the story of Havana syndrome on their channel otherwise I would never have been able to tell the world these things which I have written in my letter.\n\n15. I want to tell the whole world that I have done all this on my own, this is the result of my four years of hard work, the work which should be done by the agencies of the country, I alone showed it to the whole world.\n\n16.\n\nWhy has the USA government not taken any action against Elon Musk till now.\n\n17. It has been a year since I started giving letters, till now I have given 1,50,000 letters but till now I have not received any reply from anywhere.\n\n18. I had written in my letter a year ago that please save India from becoming a slave. I can prove that India has become a slave and if I am unable to prove it then whatever punishment my Indian government gives me, I will accept it.\n\n20. I want to tell my country peoples to share this as much as possible.\n\nGAURAV ARORA\n\nAdd: H. No.281, Chhuriya Mohalla,\n\nVillage Tekhand, Okhla Phase-1,\n\nNew Delhi-110020",

I Gaurav Arora want to tell my country people and the governments of other countries that the sky which we consider to be blue or sky blue in colour, is actually a blue coloured laser weapon. It is facing the earth. And one more thing is that this 2G 3G 4G 5G 6G 7G technology, in 2G these laser weapons are lowered further and in 3G it is lowered further and in 4G it is lowered further and in 5G it is lowered further and in 6G it is lowered further and in 7G it is lowered further and then gradually when our brain starts getting weak due to these laser weapons, then these people control our brain. Like it is happening in our India and we Indians are being told that there is an ozone layer above the sky. And one more important thing, there is no ozone layer above the earth. We are lied to and you people should also check these things in your country and one more important thing is that the sky of our India is of sky blue colour. This is also artificial. This is a blue colour laser weapon, which is pointed towards the Indian soil. This is also damaging our brain, Modiji will have to answer.Gaurav Arora want to tell the countries of the whole world that I have information about such biological weapons which are being used on the President, Politicians, Army Officers and citizens of your country. Just like they are being used on the politicians, Army Officers and citizens of our country India. You people will have to take action on these things very soon otherwise your future generation will be ruined, just like these people have ruined the future generation of our country India.\n\n4. One more thing, whichever country's people are being made victims of Havana syndrome, there will be a very small hole in their eardrum. Through that hole, these particles are being installed in the brain.\n\n5. Narendra Modi, Ajit Dobhal, Elon Musk, China, Israel and Japan have already ruined India. Now we have to tell the people living in China, Israel and Japan that they are doing all this to you people too. They also have to get out of all these things.\n\n6. I will say one thing again, the day my countrymen and even one country supports me, I will bring these people to their knees. I have some such informatio\n\nn",

    "text": "1 now the whole of india and the whole world will know what is being done to us indians. i also know this much that some very powerful person of our india is involved in all these things, without his involvement all this that I have written in my letter could not have happened. in my eyes, that person is the biggest traitor of our country india.\n\n2 i want to ask one thing to my countrymen. our brains had stopped working when corona or brain chip came. when our country's prime minister shri narendra modi ji said to ring the thali and we people played and lit diyas, and we people lit them, i had already suspected that something very wrong is going to happen with india. what kind of thing is the prime minister of such a powerful country of india shri narendra modi ji saying. tell me one thing, does ringing the thali cure any disease, does lighting diya cure any disease. this is a massacre of the innocent people of our country, and we were celebrating by ringing the thali and welcoming our upcoming death by lighting diyas. i had only then realized that this is a testing of brainchip. the truth of corona would have come out at that time if the postmortem of even one person had been done to find out whether it is corona or testing of brainchip. we people were not even given dead bodies to cremate, such a massacre has happened with us indians that even the god did not stop tears in his eyes.\n\n3 general bipin singh rawat ji who became the first chief of defence staff of india. he took over the charge of the defence post on 1 january 2020. prior to this, he was the chief of army staff from 31 december 2016 to 31 December 2019. general bipin singh rawat ji, as far as i think. all these things i have written in my letter. he had sensed many of these things before me that something very wrong is going to happen with india, because he was the first defence chief of india. before he could tell anyone, his helicopter was made to crash through artificial clouds.\n\n4. the particles that I have talked about in my letter, these particles are also present in the houses of judges, politicians and army officers of our country India. cji sanjiv khanna ji, ex-cji d.y. chandrachur ji, justice hema kohli, justice rajnish bhatnagar, justice jasmeet singh, justice seema kaur singh, justice manoj ohri, justice naina bansal, justice suhanshu trivedi, army chief general upendra trivedi, air force chief marshal a.p. singh, amit shah ji, rajnath singh ji, j.p. Nadda ji, Rahul Gandhi ji, Sonia Gandhi ji, Nitin Gadkari ji, Kejriwal ji, Raghav Chadha ji, Mayawati ji, Akhilesh Yadav ji, Manoj Tiwari ji, Kirori Lal Meena, Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, Manish Sisodia, Atishi Singh, Satish Kumar Gautam, Kapil Sibal, Pratap Kishan Jaitley. When I went to deliver the letter, I saw these particles there.\n\n5 nano particles, silver particles, golden particles and ebola virus which are being released in the atmosphere of our country india. because of this, the army of our country india and the people of the country are forced to have test tube babies. these particles are jamming our entire body and diseases like heart attack, dialysis, cancer, tb, paralysis, brain hemorrhage, liver, kidney, migraine in small children are increasing so rapidly due to these particles. when any disease comes to india, we start making medicine for it. but we do not think what is the reason for this disease? we will have to change our thinking. first of all, see how this disease came to india and what is the reason for it?\n\n6 the innocent people of my country india were looking for a chip in 2000 and 500 rupee notes, but let me tell them that it was not hidden in the note. the satellite which looks like a star in the sky above your house knew everything. these satellites have been designed in such a way that we cannot doubt them.\n\n7 today, big businessmen of our country india are leaving the country. because of all these things, i want to tell one more thing, the day the census of our india is done, the ground will slip out from under our feet.\n\n8 i gaurav arora want to ask a question to our country's prime minister shri narendra modi ji that which moon did our india send as chandrayaan to the moon, the fake one or the real one because the moon that appears in our india is a fake moon. I can prove this in 15 seconds.\n\n9 i want to ask our indian government one thing that why so much business is being done with china? do we want to make china a super power? why is 50% of the goods coming from china?\n\n10 if our country india has made such laser weapons, biological weapons, viruses and such satellites, then why are they being used on us indians and why are our country's army soldiers getting martyred.\n\n11 if my indian government had supported me, i have some such information which no other country's agency will have. whichever country will help my beloved india and my countrymen to come out of all these things, I will share this information with that country.\n\n12 these nano particles, silver particles and golden particles have been released inside our atmosphere. these particles are being put in our brain through our eyes by scanning our eyes, through these heavy mercury and led lights and through the rays of led lights which are always burning in banks these days, and in our body through food items. now you people can imagine yourself how fast these are being put in our body. we indians are going to face very bad times in the coming times.\n\n13 nano particles, silver particles and golden particles are being put in the eyes of the young children of our country who have not even seen the world properly yet by scanning their aadhar card. we can see these particles by turning off the lights of our home and office and turning on the flash light of our phones.\n\n14 in any country, if the compass does not show the right direction while standing on the ground, then understand that the climate of that country has been prepared artificially, as in our india, the compass does not show the right direction while standing on the ground.\n\n15 the sun which i have described as artificial, which china has installed in our india, through its rays, nano particles, silver particles and golden particles are being put into our brain through our eyes.\n\n16 when the climate of our country india has been created artificially, then there will be pollution. 17 Ai technology should be stopped in india, because it is brainwashing us indians.",

This means that representatives from 20 countries came to India and these particles were present in their bodies and in their food and drinks.\n[10/10, 9:00 pm] busy: our India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has studied only till sixth grade and is displaying a fake degree inside the Parliament House. It is our country's misfortune that we have an illiterate Prime Minister.\n[10/10, 9:00 pm] busy: I want to tell the ambassadors of the foreign embassies in Delhi that our country's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, Ajit Doval, Elon Musk, China, Israel, and Japan are using viruses and biological weapons against us Indians, and against you as well.\n[10/10, 9:00 pm] busy: Narendra Modi, you might remember that you said, \"What do we care? We'll just pack up and leave.\" I want to remind you of one thing: look at the history of our India. If anyone does wrong to us Indians, we Indians don't even let that person carry his bag.",

    "text": "There are some hypocrites who, no matter what Israel does, come to defend Israel by defending it with lies.\n\nThere is no one in the world who is as liar as Israel. They always break agreements, break ceasefire agreements and blame Hamas. Because the Israelis know that they have the media and power in their hands, they have the manpower to spread false narratives. Moreover, there is the entire Western media, which will always hide Israel's faults and worst crimes. And will spread false news against the people of Gaza and the West Bank. \n\nAnd the United States is there to spread all the false accusations of Israel and to support them. Have you ever thought that those hypocrites do not think with their own knowledge and conscience, that in fact what Israel is doing is not right, they do not even think that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza by bringing various false accusations and narratives to Hamas. Who will protest against this? Those who spread true news are killed by the Israeli army, and these terrorist Israeli forces have killed hundreds of international reporters in the last 2 years.  In reality, the Israelis are the real terrorists, but this is not revealed due to the blind devotion of the Western media and countries to Israel. \n\nYou will see, Israel and its hypocritical supporters will make many false accusations against Hamas, but they will never be in favor of sending a UN peacekeeping force. Because this will unmask Israel, and the heinous crimes of the Jews behind the mask will not be revealed, that is why Israel always uses its Western allies and vetoes to make decisions in favor of Israel. And America is there to blindly enslave Israel. Sorry to say! But this is the truth.\n\nIsrael will always create its own false, fabricated narrative, spread propaganda, and carry out genocide. There are media outlets in the United States, Australia, and Europe that are there to spread Israel's false accusations and cover up Israel's misdeeds.",

We already know he wants to build there.  After all, it's prime coastal real-estate.  And let's not forget the bonus.  He gets to watch innocent Muslims die.\n\nTrump is only making money here.  The armaments he's sending are paid for by hardworking Americans.  He can just sit back and watch Gaza crumble while he has his people design TRUMP RESORT, including a golf course.\n\nThis ceasefire was always a short-term sham.  He just wanted a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nHe actually thought they'd change the rules for him lol.  Little did his huge ego not realise that they wouldn't do that, let alone give the honour to him anyway at any time.\n\nThis is the man that has lied, committed insurrection, refuses to release the Epstein files (we all know why, P DOE) and is literally trying to dismantle democracy in his own country by effectively having martial law in States he didn't win !\n\nHave a nice day ! üôÑ",

While cousin marriage can be considered a form of inbreeding, it is distinct from incest.\nRothschild Cousin Marriage Practices: The Rothschild family extensively practiced cousin marriage, particularly between first and second cousins.\nReasons for Cousin Marriages: The practice was primarily driven by the desire to consolidate wealth and power within the family and maintain control over their banking empire.\nHistorical Context: Cousin marriage was a common practice among the European elite and aristocracy in the 18th and 19th centuries.\nSpecific Examples: Examples of Rothschild cousin marriages include James de Rothschild to his niece Betlty, Anselm Salomon von Rothschild to his cousin Charlotte, Lionel Nathan de 1Rothschild to his first cousin Charlotte Rothschild, and Edmond James de Rothschild to his first cousin Ad√®le de Rothschild.\nDecline of the Practice: The practice of cousin marriage within the Rothschild family declined in the 20th century due to advancements in genetic understanding and changing social norms..",

Still the vast majority of the international mainstream media has reported as if Israel would have caused what Hamas has caused for all the ordinary people living in Gaza. \r\n\r\nCNN`s, the BBC`s, the New York Times, France 24`s and multiple other Western media outlets one-sided negative reporting about Israel has not only been very helpful for Iran and to all their violent proxies, but also to Qatar, a well known Hamas supporter and Hamas financier\r\n\r\nTheir reporting has constantly had only very short interviews with Israeli officials and very long staged Hamas made reports of \"suffering Gazan civilians\". If that is not an endorsement of Hamas, nothing is.\r\n\r\nThe \"consensus among international bodies\" has been to make Israel look as bad as possible, which has formed the basis for much of the media's reporting. That is not a basis for journalism, that is a basis for one-sided anti-Israeli and pro-Hamas propaganda.\r\n\r\nThe civilian population in Gaza has faced a severe humanitarian catastrophe, but all that has been solely caused by Hamas. No attack on Israel by Hamas, no hostages by Hamas, no war in Gaza. Those simple facts about Hamas and that whole disaster in Gaza should not be too difficult to get for anybody. \r\n\r\nStill the vast majority of the Western media., including the BBC,  has been making and continues to make pro-Hamas propaganda and they have done that and they continue to do that on purpose. Why are they doing that is the key question.\n\n I strongly suspect that Qatari money has a lot to do with the BBC`s, CNN`s, France 24`s and many other big news outlets false propaganda about Israel.",

We are ALL sinners - (Rom. 6:23) For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Sin separates us from the Holy God\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. There is a punishment for our sin -(Rom. 6:23a) For the wages of sin is death;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Death - eternal death - HELL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. God loves us, He does not want us to go to Hell, He provided a way for our escape from Hell - (Rom. 5:8) But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Because of God's love for us, He sent his only son Jesus Christ to die in our place on the cross. Jesus Christ took all the weight of our sins so we can be saved through grace, NOT our works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* The blood that Jesus shed on the cross can wash away our sins and make us clean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Through Jesus Christ, we can now have eternal life in HEAVEN - (Rom. 6:23b) but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Gift - free, but you can only have it if you receive it. If you reject it then the punishment of Hell is waiting for you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. How can I receive eternal life? - (Rom. 10:9) That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* You have to admit you are a sinner and you cannot save yourself from Hell nor go to Heaven through your own efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†You have to believe in your heart that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins, was buried and rose again after 3 days and that He and only He can save you from hell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Roman 10:13) For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.¬†¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Whosoever means anyone including me and you!¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to do it? Pray this prayer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear God, I admit I am a sinner and cannot save myself from hell. I believe that Jesus Christ died for my sins, was buried and rose again. I believe that only¬† Jesus Christ can save me from Hell and He is the only way to Heaven.¬† I accept Jesus Christ in my heart as my Lord and Savior. Thank You for eternal life. Amen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,",

    "text": "I strongly suspect that Qatari money has a lot to do with the BBC`s, CNN`s, France 24`s and many other big news outlets false propaganda about Israel and their propaganda for Iran and their violent proxies. Also BBC and CNN  \"forgot\" to say that Hamas not only starved their hostages deliberately, but Hamas has also deliberately starved all ordinary people living in Gaza during their whole war against Israel.\r\n\r\nAnd that Hamas has also starved young Gazans deliberately to be able to showcase them to the international media in order to \"prove\" their false claims about Israel and starvation in Gaza, as we all have seen also here at the BBC. Then Hamas changed tactics and BBC showcased young seriously ill and /or undernourished children Hamas had deliberately starved for their propaganda purposes.\r\n\r\nAfter Hamas` change of tactics the BBC also stopped showing fat Gazan \"mothers\" \"crying\" in their news about famine. The whole international media, including BBC and CNN, must have known all that perfectly well. Looks like the whole international mainstream media has hired dishonest people like CNN`s Christiane Amanpour, people who are ready to do practically everything and anything in order to get and to keep their well paying jobs.\r\n\r\nI find Hamas`s all actions and all the methods Hamas have used for propaganda purposes more than repulsive. Hamas is more than clearly guilty of deliberately committed crimes against humanity. The vast majority of the international mainstream media, including BBC and CNN , is in my opinion guilty of protecting Hamas with their biased and false propaganda for Hamas and against Israel.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times‚Äôs Tom Friedman and CNN`s Christiane Amanpour are the two worst pro-Hamas propagandists in my opinion. They work for news outlets that the whole international media use as their \"source\" about Israel and Gaza, including the BBC. Both news outlets should finally stop their false propaganda about Israel and stop also their propaganda for Iran and for their violent proxies.\r\n\r\nHamas has already lost their fight against Israel, so why not demand them to lift a white flag to finally stop that total madness they have caused for all ordinary people living in Gaza, instead of falsely blaming Israel for what Hamas has caused and still is causing in Gaza. \r\n\nIsrael can't possibly win the massive propaganda war against them, but Israel could win the actual war against them. And that is what in the end matters the most.",

    "text": "The BBC should finally stop their pro-Hamas propaganda\r\n\r\nThe ordinary people living in Gaza have been in reality stripped of every piece of their humanity by Hamas and their cruel leaders. How is Hamas` terrorism different from ISIS` terrorism from their victims point of view? Is Hamas acting more nicely towards their victims than ISIS did?\r\n\r\nThe only real difference between ISIS`s terrorism and Hamas`s terrorism is that Hamas portrays itself as defending Palestinian national aspirations and that ISIS did not use that same excuse for their terrorism. Simply by looking at the facts one can say that the ordinary people living in Gaza don`t matter much for Hamas` leaders, regardless of their age or medical condition.\r\n\r\nHamas is not only using people they kidnapped from Israel as their hostages. Hamas also uses all ordinary people living in Gaza as their hostages. Hamas portrays itself as defending Palestinian national aspirations and Jerusalem's Muslim holy sites, when in reality Hamas is just a cruel terrorist organization.\r\n\r\nThe only thing Hamas` leaders care about is their own twisted ideology that is solely based upon cruel violence and terror. And making as much money as they possibly can for themselves that way. The fact of the matter is that if Hamas would care about the ordinary people who live in Gaza, they would have surrendered unconditionally and released all their hostages already long ago. Hamas is a cruel terrorist organization.\r\n\r\nHamas leaders don`t care one bit about what happens to ordinary people, no matter where they live or what religion they represent. Hamas` leaders decided to continue holding their hostages and continue to fight against Israel. Those two Hamas leader's decisions proves that they don`t care one bit about the disastrous consequences that their decisions have for all ordinary people living in Gaza.\r\n\r\nThat means in practice that the well-being of the ordinary people who live in Gaza does not matter one bit for Hamas` leaders. One has to be a Hamas member or a Hamas supporter not to realize all those very simple facts about Hamas and their leaders. Or a total fool.\r\n\r\nHigh time also for the BBC to get these simple facts about Hamas.",

The people of Palestine certainly rejected this decision, but the Palestinians are still emerging from occupation, so there is no way out, so they were forced to submit to this reality, and with regard to that group that says that Palestine sold its land  Palestine did not sell its land, but there were two types:\nThe first type: The elderly who were not aware of politics, when a Zionist asked them to buy land for a double amount, agreed, but they did not know what would happen because they were not aware of politics.\nThe second category: The majority of them were not Palestinians, but from different countries \nAs for the largest group whose Palestinian lands were taken, it was by force, and some of them were killed and others were forcibly displaced.\nAfter the Palestinians were forced to submit to forced coexistence with the Jews.\n\n   Britain had many weapons that they did not know what to do with, so they sold them to the Zionists. What did the Zionists do with them, in your opinion?\nYes, yes, they used it to kill the people of Palestine after they agreed to live in peace among themselves, and from here came the Nakba of 1948 and the occupation of Palestine began again after the end of the British occupation. \nÿßŸÑŸäŸàŸÖ ÿ≥ÿßÿÆÿ®ÿ±ŸÉŸÖ ÿπŸÜ ÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜ:ÿ®ÿπÿØ ÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÜÿ™Ÿáÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ±ÿ® ÿßŸÑÿπÿßŸÑŸÖŸäŸá ÿßŸÑÿ´ÿßŸÜŸäÿ© Ÿà ŸÇÿ±ÿßÿ± ÿÆÿ±Ÿàÿ¨ ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ±Ÿäÿ∑ÿßŸÜŸäŸäŸÜ ŸÖŸÜ ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜ ŸÑŸÖ ÿ™ÿÆÿ±ÿ¨ ŸÖŸÜŸáÿß ŸÖÿ´ŸÑŸÖÿß ÿÆÿ±ÿ¨ÿ™ ŸÅÿ±ŸÜÿ≥ÿß ŸÖŸÜ ŸÑÿ®ŸÜÿßŸÜ Ÿà ÿ≥Ÿàÿ±Ÿäÿß Ÿà ÿ®ÿ±Ÿäÿ∑ÿßŸÜŸäÿß ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ±ÿØŸÜ(ŸÉÿßŸÜÿ™  ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜ ŸÇÿØ  ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ŸÇÿ®ŸÑÿ™ ÿ®ŸàÿØŸäÿ© ÿ®ÿπÿ∂ ÿßŸÑŸäŸáŸàÿØ ÿßŸÑŸáÿßÿ±ÿ®ŸäŸÜ ŸÖŸÜ ÿπÿ∞ÿßÿ® Ÿáÿ™ŸÑÿ± Ÿà ÿßŸäÿ∂ÿß Ÿàÿ∂ÿπŸàÿß ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ±Ÿäÿ∑ÿßŸÜŸäŸäŸÜ ÿ®ÿπÿ∂ ÿßŸÑŸäŸáŸàÿØ ŸÅŸä ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜ Ÿà ŸÇÿØ ŸÇÿ≥ŸÖŸàÿß ÿßŸÑÿßÿ±ÿßÿ∂Ÿä ÿßŸÑŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑŸâ ÿ´ŸÑÿßÿ´ ŸÇÿ∑ÿπ 51 ŸÑŸÑÿµŸáÿßŸäŸÜÿ© Ÿà 49ŸÑÿ£ŸáŸÑ ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÖÿß ÿßŸÑŸÇÿØÿ≥ ŸÅŸÉÿßŸÜÿ™ ŸÖÿ¥ÿ™ÿ±ŸÉÿ©)ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ£ŸÉŸäÿØ ÿ±ŸÅÿ∂ ÿ£ŸáŸÑ ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜ Ÿáÿ∞ÿß ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ±ÿßÿ± Ÿà ŸÑŸÉŸÜ  ÿßŸÑŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜŸäŸàŸÜ ŸÑÿßÿ≤ÿßŸÑŸàÿß ÿÆÿßÿ±ÿ¨ŸäŸÜ ŸÖŸÜ ÿßÿ≠ÿ™ŸÑÿßŸÑ ŸÅŸÑŸäÿ≥ ÿ®ÿßŸÑŸäÿØ ÿ≠ŸäŸÑÿ© ŸÅÿßÿ∂ÿ∑ÿ±Ÿàÿß ÿ£ŸÜ Ÿäÿ±ÿ∂ÿÆŸàÿß ŸÑŸáÿ∞ÿß ÿßŸÑŸàÿßŸÇÿπ  Ÿàÿ®ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ≥ÿ®ÿ©  ŸÑÿ™ŸÑŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ¶ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ™Ÿä ÿ™ŸÇŸàŸÑ ÿßŸÜ ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜ ÿ®ÿßÿπÿ™ ÿßÿ±ÿ∂Ÿáÿß ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜ ŸÑŸÖ ÿ™ŸÇŸÖ ÿ®ÿ®Ÿäÿπ ÿßÿ±ÿ∂Ÿáÿß ÿ•ŸÜŸÖÿß  ŸÉÿßŸÜ ŸáŸÜÿßŸÉ ŸÜŸàÿπÿßŸÜ:\nÿßŸÑŸÜŸàÿπ ÿßŸÑÿßŸàŸÑ:ŸÉÿßŸÜ ŸÉÿ®ÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ∞ŸäŸÜ ŸÑÿß ŸäÿπŸÑŸÖŸàŸÜ ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ≥Ÿäÿßÿ≥ÿ© ÿπŸÜÿØŸÖÿß Ÿäÿ∑ŸÑÿ® ŸÖŸÜŸáŸÖ ÿµŸáŸäŸàŸÜŸä ÿ®ÿ¥ÿ±ÿßÿ° ÿßÿ±ÿ∂ ÿ®ŸÖÿ®ŸÑÿ∫ ŸÖÿ∂ÿßÿπŸÅ ŸäŸàÿßŸÅŸÇŸàÿß Ÿà ŸÑŸÖ Ÿäÿπÿ±ŸÅŸàÿß ŸÖÿßÿ∞ÿß ÿ≥Ÿäÿ≠ÿØÿ´ ŸÉŸàŸÜŸáŸÖ ŸÑÿß ŸäÿπŸÑŸÖŸàŸÜ ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ≥Ÿäÿßÿ≥ÿ©\nÿßŸÑŸÅÿ¶Ÿá ÿßŸÑÿ´ÿßŸÜŸäŸá:ÿßÿ∫ŸÑÿ®Ÿäÿ™ŸáŸÖ ŸÑŸÖ ŸäŸÉŸàŸÜŸàÿß ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜŸäŸäŸÜ ÿ•ŸÜŸÖÿß ŸÖŸÜ  ŸÖÿÆÿ™ŸÑŸÅ ÿßŸÑÿ®ŸÑÿØÿßŸÜ \nÿßŸÖÿß ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ¶ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿßŸÉÿ®ÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ™Ÿä ÿ£ÿÆÿ∞ÿ™ ŸÖŸÜŸáÿß ÿ£ÿ±ÿßÿ∂ŸäŸáÿß ÿßŸÑŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜŸäÿ©  ŸÅŸÉÿßŸÜÿ™ ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÉÿ±ÿßŸá  ŸàŸÖŸÜŸáŸÖ ŸÖŸÜ ÿ™ŸÖ ŸÇÿ™ŸÑŸáŸÖ Ÿàÿ¢ÿÆÿ±ŸàŸÜ ÿ™ŸÖ ÿ™Ÿáÿ¨Ÿäÿ±ŸáŸÖ ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ¨ÿ®ÿßÿ±\nÿ®ÿπÿØ ÿßÿ∂ÿ∑ÿ±ÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜŸäŸàŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿÆÿ∂Ÿàÿπ ŸÑŸÖÿπÿßŸäÿ¥ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸäŸáŸàÿØ ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÉÿ±ÿßŸá.\n\n  ŸÉÿßŸÜ ŸÑŸÑÿ®ÿ±Ÿäÿ∑ÿßŸÜ ÿßÿ≥ŸÑÿ≠ÿ© ŸÉÿ´Ÿäÿ±ÿ© ŸÑŸÖ Ÿäÿπÿ±ŸÅŸàÿß ŸÖÿßÿ∞ÿß ŸäŸÅÿπŸÑŸàŸÜ ÿ®Ÿáÿß ŸÅÿ®ÿßÿπŸàŸáÿß ŸÑŸÑÿµŸáÿßŸäŸÜÿ© ŸàŸÖÿßÿ∞ÿß ŸÅÿπŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿµŸáÿßŸäŸÜÿ© ÿ®Ÿáÿß ÿ®ÿ±ÿ£ŸäŸÉŸÖÿü\nŸÜÿπŸÖ ŸÜÿπŸÖ ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿÆÿØŸàŸÖŸáÿß ŸÑŸÇÿ™ŸÑ ÿßŸáŸÑ ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜ ÿ®ÿπÿØ ÿßÿ™ŸÅÿßŸÇ ÿßŸÜ ŸäÿπŸäÿ¥Ÿà ÿ®ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ  ŸÅŸäŸÖÿß ÿ®ŸäŸÜŸáŸÖ ŸàŸÖŸÜ ŸáŸÜÿß ÿ¨ÿßÿ°ÿ™ ŸÜŸÉÿ®ÿ© 48 Ÿà ÿ®ÿØÿ£ ÿßÿ≠ÿ™ŸÑÿßŸÑ ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜ ŸÖŸÜ ÿ¨ÿØŸäÿØ ÿ®ÿπÿØ ÿßŸÜÿ™Ÿáÿßÿ¶Ÿáÿß ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ≠ÿ™ŸÑÿßŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ±Ÿäÿ∑ÿßŸÜŸä \n\n#ŸÇÿßÿ∑ÿπ_ŸÖŸÜ_ÿ£ÿ¨ŸÑ_ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜ.   \n\nŸàÿßŸÑÿØŸÑŸäŸÑ ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿ™ÿ≠ÿ±Ÿäÿ± ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜ: \n\nindicating of the liberation of Palestine\nŸàŸéŸÇŸéÿ∂ŸéŸäŸíŸÜŸéÿß ÿ•ŸêŸÑŸéŸâŸ∞ ÿ®ŸéŸÜŸêŸä ÿ•Ÿêÿ≥Ÿíÿ±Ÿéÿßÿ¶ŸêŸäŸÑŸé ŸÅŸêŸä ÿßŸÑŸíŸÉŸêÿ™Ÿéÿßÿ®Ÿê ŸÑŸéÿ™ŸèŸÅŸíÿ≥ŸêÿØŸèŸÜŸëŸé ŸÅŸêŸä ÿßŸÑŸíÿ£Ÿéÿ±Ÿíÿ∂Ÿê ŸÖŸéÿ±ŸëŸéÿ™ŸéŸäŸíŸÜŸê ŸàŸéŸÑŸéÿ™ŸéÿπŸíŸÑŸèŸÜŸëŸé ÿπŸèŸÑŸèŸàŸëŸãÿß ŸÉŸéÿ®ŸêŸäÿ±Ÿãÿß (4) ŸÅŸéÿ•Ÿêÿ∞Ÿéÿß ÿ¨Ÿéÿßÿ°Ÿé ŸàŸéÿπŸíÿØŸè ÿ£ŸèŸàŸÑŸéÿßŸáŸèŸÖŸéÿß ÿ®ŸéÿπŸéÿ´ŸíŸÜŸéÿß ÿπŸéŸÑŸéŸäŸíŸÉŸèŸÖŸí ÿπŸêÿ®ŸéÿßÿØŸãÿß ŸÑŸëŸéŸÜŸéÿß ÿ£ŸèŸàŸÑŸêŸä ÿ®Ÿéÿ£Ÿíÿ≥Ÿç ÿ¥ŸéÿØŸêŸäÿØŸç ŸÅŸéÿ¨Ÿéÿßÿ≥ŸèŸàÿß ÿÆŸêŸÑŸéÿßŸÑŸé ÿßŸÑÿØŸëŸêŸäŸéÿßÿ±Ÿê €ö ŸàŸéŸÉŸéÿßŸÜŸé ŸàŸéÿπŸíÿØŸãÿß ŸÖŸëŸéŸÅŸíÿπŸèŸàŸÑŸãÿß (5) ÿ´ŸèŸÖŸëŸé ÿ±ŸéÿØŸéÿØŸíŸÜŸéÿß ŸÑŸéŸÉŸèŸÖŸè ÿßŸÑŸíŸÉŸéÿ±ŸëŸéÿ©Ÿé ÿπŸéŸÑŸéŸäŸíŸáŸêŸÖŸí ŸàŸéÿ£ŸéŸÖŸíÿØŸéÿØŸíŸÜŸéÿßŸÉŸèŸÖ ÿ®Ÿêÿ£ŸéŸÖŸíŸàŸéÿßŸÑŸç ŸàŸéÿ®ŸéŸÜŸêŸäŸÜŸé ŸàŸéÿ¨ŸéÿπŸéŸÑŸíŸÜŸéÿßŸÉŸèŸÖŸí ÿ£ŸéŸÉŸíÿ´Ÿéÿ±Ÿé ŸÜŸéŸÅŸêŸäÿ±Ÿãÿß (6) ÿ•ŸêŸÜŸí ÿ£Ÿéÿ≠Ÿíÿ≥ŸéŸÜÿ™ŸèŸÖŸí ÿ£Ÿéÿ≠Ÿíÿ≥ŸéŸÜÿ™ŸèŸÖŸí ŸÑŸêÿ£ŸéŸÜŸÅŸèÿ≥ŸêŸÉŸèŸÖŸí €ñ ŸàŸéÿ•ŸêŸÜŸí ÿ£Ÿéÿ≥Ÿéÿ£Ÿíÿ™ŸèŸÖŸí ŸÅŸéŸÑŸéŸáŸéÿß €ö ŸÅŸéÿ•Ÿêÿ∞Ÿéÿß ÿ¨Ÿéÿßÿ°Ÿé ŸàŸéÿπŸíÿØŸè ÿßŸÑŸíÿ¢ÿÆŸêÿ±Ÿéÿ©Ÿê ŸÑŸêŸäŸéÿ≥ŸèŸàÿ°ŸèŸàÿß ŸàŸèÿ¨ŸèŸàŸáŸéŸÉŸèŸÖŸí ŸàŸéŸÑŸêŸäŸéÿØŸíÿÆŸèŸÑŸèŸàÿß ÿßŸÑŸíŸÖŸéÿ≥Ÿíÿ¨ŸêÿØŸé ŸÉŸéŸÖŸéÿß ÿØŸéÿÆŸéŸÑŸèŸàŸáŸè ÿ£ŸéŸàŸëŸéŸÑŸé ŸÖŸéÿ±ŸëŸéÿ©Ÿç ŸàŸéŸÑŸêŸäŸèÿ™Ÿéÿ®ŸëŸêÿ±ŸèŸàÿß ŸÖŸéÿß ÿπŸéŸÑŸéŸàŸíÿß ÿ™Ÿéÿ™Ÿíÿ®ŸêŸäÿ±Ÿãÿß (7)(ÿ≥Ÿàÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿ±ÿßÿ°)",

    "text": "Why are they palestinian prisoners and not palestinian hostages? To be clear, most of these Palestinian ‚Äúprisoners‚Äù are held under administrative detention. According to human rights organizations, Israel‚Äôs dual legal system constitutes apartheid, as it enforces separate and unequal treatment based on nationality and ethnicity. Under this system, Palestinians, including children, are often detained without charge or trial under administrative detention orders. As of December 1, 2024, Israeli authorities held 2,873 Palestinians in administrative detention, marking a three-decade high. Amnesty International has documented the systematic use of torture and degrading treatment of Palestinian detainees, including beatings, stress positions, and denial of medical care, all of which violate international law.\r\n\r\nGiven this context, these detainees are not conventional prisoners and it‚Äôs better to describe them as hostages. This distinction is critical, as it challenges the implicit narrative that Palestinians in Israeli prisons have all been convicted of criminal offenses, when in reality, many are held without charge or trial. Reframing their status as hostages better reflects the power dynamics at play and highlights the broader context of occupation and human rights violations by Israel.\r\n\r\nSince you referred to the Israelis in the exchange as hostages, it seems only fair to refer to the Palestinians in the same manner. Failure to do so is a double-standard.",

    "text": "The Unwitting Failure of Ethnicity‚Ä¶\n\nFrom the perspective of unwitting ethnicity failure, Israel‚Äôs conduct following the belated ceasefire in the Middle East exposes a profound moral dissonance between its proclaimed spiritual heritage and its present political behaviour. The government‚Äôs refusal to deploy heavy excavation machinery to recover the remains of hostages‚Äîalongside tens of thousands of Palestinians still buried under the 85% of Gaza reduced to rubble‚Äîamounts not only to administrative neglect, but to a symbolic act of indifference, rubbing salt into the still-open wounds of Arab-Israeli relations.\n\nWorse still, the continued restriction of humanitarian aid and the cynical use of food as a weapon of control reflect a dangerous pattern: a nation once defined by its historical suffering has learned to wield suffering as an instrument of power. This tragic inversion is not mere political misjudgment‚Äîit is the manifestation of an unprocessed ethnic trauma, where collective fear and inherited grievance distort moral vision.\n\nIn this sense, many 21st-century Israelis‚Äîoften unconsciously‚Äîhave become victims of their own mythic narrative. By over-interpreting the biblical idea of a ‚ÄúGreater Israel,‚Äù they mistake spiritual allegory for territorial entitlement. The ancient texts that once served as ethical mirrors for self-refinement have been reduced to literal claims of supremacy, betraying their original moral intent.\n\nWhen Netanyahu's Zionist government elevates this literalism to state policy, it effectively implements a collective moral inversion‚Äîreenacting its own past oppression while blaming others. As a result, what we witness is not faith, but fear; not prophecy, but pathology‚Äîa political form of historical post-traumatic stress disorder. This is the tragedy of a nation seeking redemption through rule, yet risking the loss of the moral soul that once determined its survival. In February 2025, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant admitted that the IDF followed \"Hannibal's instructions\" during the Gaza War‚Äîpreferring to kill Israelis rather than be taken hostage, and prioritising the elimination of the enemy over the rescue of hostages during raids into enemy territory. This is a vivid example of how a Zionist-driven Israeli government has fallen into the trap of tribal survival.\n\nUltimately, history teaches that any people who fail to transform their trauma into wisdom will repeat it upon others. When pain remains unexamined, it hardens into ideology; when fear becomes identity, compassion disappears. True national maturity arises not from victory or vengeance, but from the courage to transcend inherited wounds. Only by recognising this shared human frailty can both Israelis and Arabs‚Äîand indeed all nations‚Äîmove toward a peace grounded not in dominance, but in dignity.",

    "text": "What liars, america and israel, through their biased, partisan black ops unit, called fox news. israel have continued the genocide non-stop since getting the living hostages back. us state dept are as always, war-mongering criminals . This is not news to our group, all retired ex military, ex humanitarian workers within UN. Do they really think americans are that stupid as to believe this nonsense here on fox perverted news ? This is one of our recent posts explaining why it is almost impossible to return the dead hostages, looking back at our experiences trying to locate and identify bodies in Kosovo. Read and learn, if this post is not also wiped out by zionist algorithms as has happened to hundreds of our truthful posts here in the last month alone. \n\"This is all BS. Dead bodies, buried by Hamas volunteers, who in turn were massacred by american-israeli bombs. Then the terrain is worked over by idf bulldozers. How in hell can anyone know where they are now ??? I remember well the weeks we spent in the mass graves of Kosovo-Macedonia, looking to identify and return to their families the remains of Kosovan Albanians murdered by the Serbs. We started in a much clearer place than Hamas has in Gaza. The numbers were a small fraction of the 150.000 to 230,000 bodies believed to lie under rubble in Gaza after the deliberate murder of all living Palestinians by the IDF. We also knew where the bodies were, but we couldn't determine individual identities without painstaking weeks of scrupulous DNA testing of every bone, by teams of forensic pathologists and forensic anthropologists, backed up by world-class laboratory supports. None of this is available to Hamas. We are talking about sites with tens of thousands of cadavers strewn around and these are almost all deliberately churned into un-recognisable mush by the IDF bulldozers, who for two years have been churning up and destroying all human traces in any cemetary in Gaza they find and doing the same to every bombed building, to cause maximum grief to families missing loved ones. \nSo, commentators, look back over the vile, hateful rubbish you have spewed here and have a good look at yourself. The black propogandists who made the tape know well what they are doing. They lie and spew hate for a living. Fox is a cancer, not a news outlet. But stop with the sick, hate driven nonsense, from fools who never saw piles of dead bodies, much less piles of minced human flesh and bones, deliberately and painstakingly churned to scraps by the inhuman zionist monsters and their american supplied bulldozers. \"\n\ntrump does not want the truce to hold. He wants to make money from stealing sea-front real-estate, in Gaza, through his son-in-law's corrupt deals with his fellow criminals.",

Why IDF stand down for 6 long hours and let hamas running around doing all those things????? Charles kirk said its hard to believe Hamas can enter israel border on land yet 6 hrs inside. Plus now why Charles kirk die? All these coincidence? Did you forget israel created Hamas to toppled down PLO Governing Paletine? Now why all of these became coincidence? Now Netanyahu already signed $35 Billions Gas Deal with the Egypt. Gaza Marine contain 1.3 Trillion cubic feet of Natural Gas and thats money $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$. Who is hamas really with all those time covering theirface ????? Do you think hamas will release that hostages? Answer is Not until Gaza is totally occupied by israel. Netanyahu wont release this hostages and we are not stupid as he thinks. Hamas and IDF belongs to Netanyahu and they are just pawns in this game. Its all about lLand Power and Money. Netanyahu using his own people for his own benefits.",

How could Israel do that and get away with it ???\nWhat kind of world?\nAnd Trump wants a noble peace prize üèÜ \nShame\nAll those players are just looking for opportunities to make billions out of those devastated people. not for free",

Some alarming events will occur then which are left out for shortness here. Prophet Mohammad Hadiths also predict that ultimately a Muslim Army from the area of Ancient Khorasan will come and defeat Isrel to free the Holy Muslim sites. Ancient Khorasan now covers parts of Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. \n\nIt is no coincidence that the exact above three non-Arab Muslim countries have had externally organized regime changes, multiple wars and economic sanctions since decades to keep them weak to ever fight with Isrel. \n\nThe Isreli one sided peace plan is unfolding now. The Iranian nuclear sites were bombed in 2025. Through a foreign supported dictator Ruler in Pakistan, the country has been destroyed in the last three years. In both 2024 and 2025, Pakistan was sanctioned for building long range missiles ‚Äúcapable of reaching Isrel‚Äù. Whenever needed in future, Pakistan will be forced to give up its nuclear weapons for a loan or else become bankrupt. In 1994 Ukraine was forced to give up its nuclear weapons in the Budapest Memorandum and after that has lost 20% of its land in ethnic regions. Pakistan could again be broken up along ethnic regions as in 1971. \n\nPakistan recently pushed back Afghan refugees across the border and is trying to fight a war with Afghanistan which will benefit Isrel directly by weakening two key non-Arab Muslim countries. \n\nAs soon as Pakistan is forced to hand over its nuclear weapons the only hope of a Muslim Army freeing the Holy Muslim and Christian sites in future will be greatly decreased.",

Hamas did not returned all hostages but the media has been made to say that the exchange of hostages is a success.

If you knew me you would know my Father too.‚Äù ‚Äì (The Prophet and Messiah Jesus of Nazareth at John 14: 6-7)‚Äì So never worship and pray in the way of the many false prophets who lead all religions. \r\n‚ÄúBut when you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. In your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. Do not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him.\r\nThis is how you should pray:\r\nOur Father in heaven, \r\nHallowed be your name,\r\nYour kingdom come; \r\nYour will be done, on earth as in heaven,\r\nGive us today our daily bread,\r\nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\r\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one.\r\nFor yours is the kingdom, and the power and the glory, for ever.\r\nAmen.\r\nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.‚Äù ‚Äì (The Prophet and Messiah Jesus of Nazareth at Matthew 6: 6-15) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me shall never be hungry, and whoever believes in me shall never be thirsty‚Äù ‚Äì (at John 6: 35) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúPass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.‚Äù ‚Äì (at Matthew 7: 1-2) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúIn truth I tell you, if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.‚Äù ‚Äì (at John 8: 51) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAlways treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\r\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 12-14) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\r\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 10: 9-10) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúBeware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 15) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n ‚ÄúNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 21) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúI am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and any one who is alive and has faith shall never die.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 11: 25-26) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI have not come to judge the world, but to save the world‚Äù ‚Äì (John 12: 47) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúWhoever then will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 10: 32-34) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 14: 6-7) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúAn expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‚ÄòTeacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?‚Äô He answered, ‚ÄòLove the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. Everything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 22: 35-40) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThere is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 15: 13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúDo not call any man on earth ‚Äòfather‚Äô ; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‚Äòteacher‚Äô ; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 23: 9-10) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTake care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 4) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúMany false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men‚Äôs love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. ‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 11-13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTeach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And be assured, I am with you always, to the end of time.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 28: 20) ‚Äì\r\n\r\nYours, in true Spirit and in our one given prayer, 2gointruth, on Tuesday the 14th of October 2025: ‚Äì (Please read Matthew 5: 14-16) ‚Äì Where every minute (of both day and night) can be a new beginning for any one of us.",

    "text": "Interesting news‚ù§\n\nAnd, I have additional comments for Dear President Donald J. Trump,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out with a heartfelt request for your esteemed leadership to address critical issues concerning Ethiopia, particularly regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and the historical access to the Asseb port, as well as to propose solutions to end Ethiopia‚Äôs internal conflicts.\nThe Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD):\nThe GERD is a vital project for Ethiopia, symbolizing national pride and a pathway to sustainable development through clean energy and economic growth. However, ongoing disputes with Egypt over the dam‚Äôs management have escalated tensions in the region. I respectfully urge you to encourage Egypt‚Äôs leadership to adopt a more collaborative approach in discussions about the GERD. A balanced dialogue that respects Ethiopia‚Äôs right to harness its natural resources while addressing downstream concerns could pave the way for a mutually beneficial agreement. Your influence could help de-escalate tensions and promote a spirit of cooperation among Nile Basin countries.\nRestoration of Asseb Port Access:\nHistorically, the Asseb port was a critical lifeline for Ethiopia‚Äôs trade and economic stability. Since Eritrea‚Äôs independence, Ethiopia‚Äôs landlocked status has posed significant challenges to its economy. I kindly request your support in advocating for renewed access to the Asseb port for Ethiopia, potentially through diplomatic negotiations with Eritrea. Restoring Ethiopia‚Äôs access to this port would enhance regional trade, reduce economic strain, and foster stability in the Horn of Africa. Your voice in supporting Ethiopia‚Äôs historical and economic ties to Asseb could be a game-changer for the region.\nSolutions to Ethiopia‚Äôs Internal Conflicts:\nEthiopia is grappling with internal conflicts that threaten its unity and progress. To address these challenges and promote lasting peace, I propose the following solutions:\nInclusive National Dialogue: Encourage Ethiopia‚Äôs government to initiate a transparent and inclusive national dialogue involving all ethnic groups, political factions, and civil society. This platform could address grievances, promote reconciliation, and build trust among communities.\nCeasefire Agreements: Advocate for immediate ceasefires in conflict zones, particularly in regions like Tigray, Amhara, and Oromia, to create space for humanitarian aid and peace talks.\nEconomic Development Programs: Support investments in job creation, infrastructure, and education to address root causes of unrest, such as poverty and marginalization. International partnerships, potentially facilitated by your influence, could help fund these initiatives.\nStrengthening Governance: Promote reforms that enhance democratic institutions, ensure equitable representation, and protect human rights, fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose among Ethiopia‚Äôs diverse population.\nInternational Mediation: Endorse the involvement of neutral international mediators, such as the African Union or United Nations, to facilitate peace negotiations and ensure impartiality.\nYour leadership and global influence could play a pivotal role in guiding Ethiopia toward peace and prosperity. By addressing the GERD dispute, advocating for Asseb port access, and supporting solutions to internal conflicts, you have the opportunity to help Ethiopia overcome its challenges and strengthen regional stability.\nThank you for considering this appeal. I am confident that your wisdom and commitment to global peace can make a profound difference. üôèüôèüôè\n\nWith utmost respect,\nAlemayehu Siffir Argawu (PhD Candidate)\nAndhra University, India",

    "text": "The Oct-7 Hamas terrorist attack must be considered God‚Äôs last sent warning to Israel. Fortunately, at this crucial time in its history Israel has an experienced leader like Netanyahu to lead the nation & secure Israel. \r\nIf Hamas is let off this time, new incarnation of Hamas with much more lethal weapons will rise in future making the present barbaric attack & hostage taking look a pedestrian affair. Israel may also lose air superiority advantage next time. \r\nThe West Bank is like a fist into the body of Israel in the map & if any future incarnation of Hamas occupies it & launches Oct-7 type attacks from there, it will jeopardize the very existence of Israel. \r\nVacating Gaza in 2005 by shifting Jewish townships & trusting PA leadership was a mistake. Denouncing Oslo Agreements & refusing to recognize Israel‚Äôs existence, Hamas executed PA opponents & took control of Gaza in 2007. Similar thing can happen in future to the West Bank. The stark choice for Israel is now or never. \r\nIt is now a struggle for survival of Israel. It is the anti-Jewish religious indoctrination from infant age that generates constant crop of terrorists. De-radicalization of that ideology requires Israel to continuous control & supervision of all Palestinian territories for several decades. It is difficult task but achievable else it will be too late. \r\nAl Taqiyya: Deceiving the infidels for the good of Islam is considered a virtue in Islam. The US was deceived & OBL was hidden because of this virtue.\r\nThe WW2 victorious Winston Churchill said: ‚ÄúIf you will not fight for right when you can easily win without bloodshed; if you will not fight when your victory is sure and not too costly; you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival\".",

Humble yourselves and show the world what you preach about love of god. If your such good people as you say show us. You are not special compared to anyone else we are all human. If you want respect on the world stage earn it. Pride is a sin read and understand.  Humble yourselves negotiate live in peace and love for all humanity not just yourselves.  Have humility for all that have lost their lives not just your side.  Stop playing the victims.  Your only a victim when you allow yourself to be so.  Move forward  with love respect for all people",

    "text": "Seeing all those Israeli people jumping around and dancing, knowing full well they don't give one single F about all the dead children they neighbour makes me sick to my stomach. Must be nice getting your husbands back (Btw, all of which ex-IDF) but there's parents who will never get their children back, children who don't get to see their next birthday, get to grow up and find love, because of a murderous and monstrous regime who have attacked Lebanon 6 times, attacked 6 other neighbouring countries. Imagine any other Nation on the planet attacked 7 different countries, the world would mobilise and end them. The truth is, Israel can do anything it wants because it's people are Jewish, because of 1939, Jews can't do anything wrong. It's sickening. Now the hostages have returned, do you think Israel will allow children to live? I HIGHLY doubt it. Israel hates Palestine and doesn't believe they should live, despite oppressing their Nation for almost 80 years. Do you think Israel will allow international journalists to go and see what's actually happening while there's a cease fire? After all, they won't allow people because of security concerns, right?",

    "text": "Brothers and sisters, warriors for justice, voices for the voiceless:\n\nWe stand today at a crossroads of history. We are witnessing not a moment of decline, but of awakening. We see empires ‚Äî built on lies, corruption, fear, and division ‚Äî falter under their own weight. The structures that once seemed impregnable are cracking. And we ‚Äî the people ‚Äî hold the power to push them further, to make them crumble, to build something new from their ruins.\n\nThey fear our unity. They rely on our silence. But when we speak, when we act, when we refuse to relent, their scaffolding begins to shake. Their illusions of invincibility are just that ‚Äî illusions.\n\nToday I call on you: rise up in solidarity. Let your anger burn with purpose. Let your fear be transformed into resolve. Let your voice echo beyond the walls of oppression.\n\nBecause they count on us to be divided. They rely on us to despair. But we will not give them that gift.\n\nWe must expose the lies, reveal the hidden hands, and tear away the masks. We must demand accountability, transparency, justice. We must hold every corrupt leader to the light. We must dismantle the systems that prey on the vulnerable. We must uproot the greed that feeds on suffering.\n\nBut this is not a distant hope ‚Äî this is a task for us, here and now. You who listen: your courage matters. Your solidarity matters. Your refusal to walk away matters.\n\nEvery chant, every protest, every act of resistance, no matter how small, is a blow against the illusion of power. Every truth told against the tides of deception becomes a pillar in a new foundation. Every hand extended across divides becomes a bridge of humanity.\n\nThey would have us believe we are powerless. They would have us believe we are isolated. They would have us believe it is too late.\n\nWe say: No. We are already in motion. We are already many. We are already unstoppable.\n\nSo we march. We shout. We organize. We resist. We create. We heal. We rebuild.\n\nAnd when future generations ask: where were you when the empire cracked? ‚Äî we will say: we were there. We fought. We rose. We built something better.\n\nLet them tremble ‚Äî for the power has always been ours. Let them fall ‚Äî for their time is ending. And let us rise ‚Äî for the dawn of justice is ours to shape.\n\nRise, awaken, act.\n\nWe are the reckoning.",

If you knew me you would know my Father too.‚Äù ‚Äì(The Prophet and Messiah Jesus of Nazareth at John 14: 6-7) ‚Äì So never worship and pray in the way of the many false prophets who lead all religions. \r\n‚ÄúBut when you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. In your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. Do not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him.\r\nThis is how you should pray:\r\nOur Father in heaven, \r\nHallowed be your name,\r\nYour kingdom come; \r\nYour will be done, on earth as in heaven,\r\nGive us today our daily bread,\r\nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\r\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one.\r\nFor yours is the kingdom, and the power and the glory, for ever.\r\nAmen.\r\nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.‚Äù ‚Äì (The Prophet and Messiah Jesus of Nazareth at Matthew 6: 6-15) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me shall never be hungry, and whoever believes in me shall never be thirsty‚Äù ‚Äì (at John 6: 35) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúPass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.‚Äù ‚Äì (at Matthew 7: 1-2) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúIn truth I tell you, if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.‚Äù ‚Äì (at John 8: 51) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAlways treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\r\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 12-14) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\r\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 10: 9-10) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúBeware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 15) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n ‚ÄúNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 21) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúI am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and any one who is alive and has faith shall never die.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 11: 25-26) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI have not come to judge the world, but to save the world‚Äù ‚Äì (John 12: 47) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúWhoever then will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 10: 32-34) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 14: 6-7) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúAn expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‚ÄòTeacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?‚Äô He answered, ‚ÄòLove the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. Everything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 22: 35-40) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThere is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 15: 13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúDo not call any man on earth ‚Äòfather‚Äô ; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‚Äòteacher‚Äô ; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 23: 9-10) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTake care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 4) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúMany false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men‚Äôs love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. ‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 11-13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTeach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And be assured, I am with you always, to the end of time.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 28: 20) ‚Äì\r\n\r\nYours, in true Spirit and in our one given prayer, 2gointruth, on Tuesday the 14th of October 2025: ‚Äì (Please read Matthew 5: 14-16) ‚Äì Where every minute (of both day and night) can be a new beginning for any one of us.",

And to those who think that the war is over just because some b*rb*r!c terror!st organization blackmailed the world and the State of Israel to release 1,799 d>sp!cable terrorists for 20 live hostages and another 39 dead,\n  doesn't understand what they're talking about. \n Now that the Israeli hostages are not being used as human shields,\n  we'll see how brave the Hamas terror!sts are, \n those r*p!sts and murd*r*rs, p*d*ph!les, are.  Their time will come. \n There's still a lot of work to do in Gaza.  The first phase will end relatively quickly.  We'll see what happens in the next round. \n The Palestinians will not accept  No room to move, \n What is going to happen in Gaza is a dismantling and reassembly that will last for decades,",

    "text": "Reminds me of this paragraph by Chris Hedges the NYTs Senior Israel correspondence for like 10 years:\n\nThe brazenness of Israeli lies stunned those of us who reported from Gaza. It did not matter if we had seen the Israeli attack, including the shooting of unarmed Palestinians. It did not matter how many witnesses we interviewed. It did not matter what photographic and forensic evidence we obtained. Israel lied. Small lies. Big lies. Huge lies. These lies came reflexively and instantly from the Israeli military, Israeli politicians and Israeli media. They were amplified by Israel‚Äôs well-oiled propaganda machine and repeated with a cloying sincerity on international news outlets.\nIsrael engages in the kinds of jaw-dropping lies that characterize despotic regimes. It does not deform the truth, it inverts it. It paints a picture that is diametrically opposed to reality. Those of us who have covered the occupied territories have run into Israel‚Äôs Alice-in-Wonderland narratives, which we dutifully insert into our stories ‚Äî required under the rules of American journalism ‚Äî although we know they are untrue.",

Even now, part of the request for an agreement is that Hamas disarm and have nothing with the re-establishment and running of Gaza. They have not agreed. If they refuse then that could be a deal breaker to the rest of and continuation of any peace agreement. The people have already moved back when they should avoid the place till it is safe to go back. Glad to see the hostages finally released. It should never have happened. I doubt this is the end...Zechariah 14.",

No imprisonment for what they did? What a deal.\n\nAnd Later today the Western powers and a few extraordinarily wealthy Arab countries will agree a deal to pay for the re-building of Gaza. Free houses, schools ,and the latest hospitals  for the people who cheered as the dead and dying bodies of women and even children were draped over motorcycles or thrown into trucks having been mercilessly raped. What a deal.\n\nNo one has said a thing about re-educating the visceral antisemitism taught to all Palestinian children in their schools from continuing, once the West largely pays for the murderously intolerant Palestinian Islamist supremacists to take over power once again, and continue their pledge to wipe out their neighbours from the river \"Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea\", and then invade and destroy the West which will have paid to rebuild their \"state\".

This is how we end up in such tragic conditions for both Palestinians and for Israel whose leaders are now considered War Criminals by the international community.",

Instead, he has passionately supported Israel as it has killed nearly 60,000 people, mostly civilians, during its genocidal campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, he has yet to commit himself and American money and arms to forcing Putin to stop murdering civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe reasons for this are clear to everyone: He gravitates toward and strongly supports tyrants like himself, is racist when it comes to Muslims (and others), and hates Zelenskyy because Ukraine's president is the only leader in the world who has stood up to him.",

    "text": "In Mauro Biglino's book Gods Of The Bible. He transcribes the oldest stories from the World's numerous Bibles with an exacting interpretation, including the Annunaki and the connection between Israel and yahweh. He found the incredible stories had been copied from far earlier accounts going back many hundreds of thousands of years.  The Vatican had employed Mauro to translate some of their oldest documents because of his credible academic work. But Mauro found accounts of visitors from other planets in their archived manuscripts. The Vatican immediately cancelled Mauro's employment as his translations exposed current man-made religions that have duped the world for two thousand years. More revelations on Mauro Biglino's Official Channel which has subtitles.",

Finally, stop prioritizing business over human lives and stop arms supplies to Israel and Ukraine. It is easy, but there is clearly a lack of goodwill, instead there are only empty words and so far no guarantees for Palestine, only a ceasefire without concrete security guarantees and guarantees of freedom and sovereignty for Palestine and its government representatives. You asked Russia to pay war reparations to Ukraine! After the genocide committed by Israel in Gaza, with unconditional support from the US, will Israel and the US now also pay reparations to the Palestinians for the completely devastated territory and infrastructure!???",

    "text": "The Profiteering System Behind the Conflict\nFrom 2018 until just before the October 7th attacks, approximately $30 million per month flowed to Hamas through Qatar‚Äîtotaling nearly $2 billion. This arrangement was facilitated through coordination between U.S. officials (including a 2018 letter from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin assuring Qatar the payments wouldn't be considered terrorism financing), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Qatari officials who provided Hamas an office in Doha (New York Times, December 10, 2023).\nNetanyahu's Strategy: Strengthen Hamas to Prevent Peace\nIn 2019, Netanyahu publicly stated: \"Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas.\" This wasn't a secret‚Äîit was deliberate policy to prevent Palestinian unity by keeping Hamas strong and preventing a two-state solution. Israeli intelligence warned multiple times (2019, 2020) that funds were being diverted to Hamas's military wing, but Netanyahu continued the payments anyway (New York Times, December 10, 2023).\nFollow the Money: Who Profits From War?\nMembers of Congress hold millions in defense contractor stocks and directly profit when conflicts escalate. After October 7th, defense stocks surged: RTX Corporation jumped 9%, Lockheed Martin rose 9%, and Northrop Grumman gained 11% (Newsweek, November 2, 2023). Elected officials who vote on military aid packages while holding these stocks face an obvious conflict of interest‚Äîthey financially benefit from prolonging war rather than pursuing peace.\nConstruction Companies Betting on Destruction\nIsraeli construction firms have seen massive stock gains during active combat:\nShikun & Binui: +100% annual gain, +29% in October 2025 alone\nOther construction stocks showing similar patterns\nWhy would construction stocks surge during a war? Because investors are betting on reconstruction contracts. The system profits from a cycle: destroy infrastructure, then profit from rebuilding it.\nDisplacement as Business Opportunity\nEco Buildings Group, a modular housing company with operations in Sudan, saw a 380% stock surge coinciding with Israeli officials' proposals for Palestinian \"voluntary emigration\" to Sudan. This suggests investors are anticipating profits from mass displacement‚Äîtreating ethnic cleansing as a business opportunity.\nEnergy: The Hidden Motive\nIn August 2023‚Äîjust two months before October 7th‚ÄîChevron approved a $429 million expansion of Israel's Leviathan gas field to increase production capacity. Meanwhile, Gaza's Marine gas field (estimated worth: billions) remains deliberately undeveloped. Keeping Gaza unstable prevents Palestinian energy independence and eliminates competition for Israeli gas companies.\nHamas Leadership Profits Too\nThe U.S. Treasury confirmed Hamas operates a \"secret investment portfolio\" worth hundreds of millions through companies in Turkey, Sudan, and Algeria. Hamas leadership lives in luxury in Qatar while Gazans suffer under blockade. They divert humanitarian aid for military purposes and personal enrichment.\nThe International Court's Findings\nThe International Court of Justice issued three provisional measures (January, March, and May 2024) finding a \"plausible risk of genocide\" in Gaza. In September 2024, a UN Commission concluded that \"Israel has committed genocide in Gaza\" (UN OHCHR, September 16, 2024). Over 46,000 Palestinians have been killed, 1.9 million displaced, and 60% of infrastructure destroyed.\nThe Bottom Line\nThis isn't about picking sides between Israelis and Palestinians‚Äîboth civilian populations are victims. This is about exposing a system where:\nPolitical leaders on multiple sides financially benefit from conflict\nDefense contractors profit from weapons sales\nConstruction companies profit from destruction and rebuilding\nEnergy companies profit from preventing Palestinian development\nHamas leadership profits while their own people starve\nThe cycle works like this: Fund instability ‚Üí conflict erupts ‚Üí weapons sales surge ‚Üí infrastructure destroyed ‚Üí reconstruction contracts awarded ‚Üí repeat. Every stage generates profits for someone while civilians on all sides pay with their lives.\nUntil we address the profit motive driving perpetual conflict, peace will remain impossible. Both Israeli and Palestinian civilians deserve better than being used as pawns in other people's money-making schemes.",

AJ also half-a¬∞sed the fake prisoner exchange dichotomy that western media were doing by calling one side \"captives\" and the other \"prisoners\". \nAJ has been very distinctly soft-peddling normalisation since at least the successful collaborative destruction of syr¬∞¬∞ including IL and turkey/qatar. but now with the fake ceasefire (it's a surrender, much like h¬∞zb¬∞ll¬∞h's fake ceasefire), AJ has gotten really unsubtle about aligning with IL.",

It is their own fault if they fall from power.  Gaza should adopt following the U.S. Constitution.  It is an expansion of the law of Moses.  It is what is fair and just.  All the court rulings on any issue are posted online.  Nothing is hidden.  It would bring peace and if you replace hate and murder in your hearts with love and forgiveness and learn to care for one another then real prosperity will take hold.  Under U.S. law any law that conflicts with the US Constitution is void.  Use that as  guide to what society should do.

They disarmed their warriors (called savages by the white oppressor) through force, lies, victories, promises - and then the 'indian' people, namely children, elderly, women, sick - were helpless and then annihilated despite white promises! The last ones were brought to reservations and they sent for them poisoned blankets after they exterminated 60 million buffalos (officially just 6 millions)! This was the end of the indigenous people and some survived then in reservations...)\nThe situation in Gaza and Palestine is similar! I mean they have the choice between the pest and the cholera! If they don't disarm, other countless innocent women and children shall be slaughtered and stomped into the earth, if they disarm - the innocent population is completely helpless and the result is the same! Furthermore: WHO IS HAMAS - who are the different people behind it? As the Izhell sympathisers say 'they have no uniforms' - so it is logic that they are composed from many different entities, among them so-called gangs which Bibi admittedly sent to Gaza...\nFAZIT: I don't trust neither western tongues nor Izhell, but great part of Israeli Intellectuals, Religious, Artists, Journalists etc! are on the good side of history - hence AGAINST this Genozidal occupation! And after reading comments on this and other channels I clearly can see that the genozidal part is ruthless, unpolite and uneducated, while the friends of Palestine, including Jewish Intelligentsia is wise and polite! This is the impression I got over a very long time! I hope that this one shall pass! Otherwise it was really my last comment here! Peace for ALL LIVING BEINGS!",

I‚Äôd love to see him try speaking other languages! Rude as always such a clown with weak personality. Everyone except him understood her. Let‚Äôs face it, he just avoided the question. I hate this about americans: they flooded the world with their media and movies and made English the international language. Almost every leader in the world can speak at least some English, but I‚Äôd like to hear him speak Spanish, Chinese, or French, languages that are widely spoken.\n\n\nNot to mention that he is saying Palentine (in english) which is not even pronounced palestine the way we pronounce it in english and many other leaders are calling their countries and regions in english instead of calling them by their original name only for those losers to be able to understand. Imagine Macron saying Paris and France in french instead of english when he speaks to trump about France. Such an hypocritical pig.",

Their positions on Israel have been shaped by their relationships with pro-Israel groups and donors, reflecting the complex dynamics of US politics and Middle East policy.

    "text": "In regard to Palestine, It is critical that we meticulously document every event, atrocity, statement, tweet, action, violation, double standard, lie, news coverage/headline/report, any statements influencers/celebs (like Jared Kushner/Dr Phil/Van Jones/Ben Shapiro/Patrick Bet-David/Jordan Peterson/Donald Trump jr/Peter Thiel/Alex Karp/Stramer statements they‚Äôve made/tweets) and war crime on a dedicated website in regards to Palestine, show everything happening in Gaza and the West Bank by the IDF. Something like a time capsule/archive/database site/online museum like a Youtube/TikTok/Wikileaks/Wiki/AP Archive all combined where we show as much proof as possible (in as many ways digestible to people. We need an alternative to social media and mainstream news (both which is heavily censored and will continue to be). Not everyone gets information the same way (still many rely on msm/news headlines/social media). We need a platform that can‚Äôt be censored and where we can show all the truth unfiltered. People need to see the atrocities. Tracking every IDF power tripping/committing war crimes clips, every Israeli/American politician statement/quote/tweet/action (ex. John Fetterman/Brian Mast/as many as we can find/Why Trump pardoned Aviem Sella and Pollard/every AIPAC politician). \n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nALL OF IT. From America/Middle East/UK/Austrlia/Anywhere in the world Zio's have an infleunce.\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nBefore and after October. (I've been looking at 2014/2008/2022/pre-1948 Gaza and barely any resources that show lots of details/context/events/atrocities documented)\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nWe can't afford to underestimate how much people don't know, are unaware or understand about these issues and there‚Äôs so much context we might be missing to see, better to organize all of it‚Äì we need to preserve a comprehensive record of as much proof as possible. We can‚Äôt afford Iraq/Afghanistan war like ignorance anymore, we have to spread as much awareness as we can. Please save everything you find, encourage others to as well. Social media will be censored soon and I have no faith in mainstream media at this point. This needs to be a mindset/BDS like movement. They will double down on the censorship/genocide denial and we have to fight back and at least keep track of history at it's happening. \n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\nDon't underestimate how unaware people are especially Americans. At the end of the day America has the most power to change the situation. Not everyone's algo is the same, all main social media outlets are owned by the same group as is mainstream media. We will see a push of censorship/\"anti-israel laws\"/genocide denial/the same talking points repeated (hostages/kamas/radical islam). We need to keep spreading awareness and keep waking people up. Lets keep track of as much context/events/history as it's happening. We can't let any moment be forgotten.\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\nCheck my channel I've highlighted 3 platforms: WaterMelonCrimes, TikTokGenocide and Gaza23 (add a dotcom to any). We need more platforms like this, please encourage it! Imagine if students/activisits/organizations/academics/journalists/the people all collabed on sometihng like this for Iraq/Afghanistan/Libya? showing the past from Iraq/Afghanistan/Libya.. the journalists/news channels/companies that profited from those wars.  We need to show patterns/past behaviour and wake as many people up, we can't afford Iraq/Afghanistan war like ignorance no more especially from Americans. Once they wake up in mass we might see true change!\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nPlease spread this message!!!! Show people that typically dont see the other side ample proof. they may not believe but we tried and at least we keep track of history.",

ACTION REQUESTED: @POTUS (die-hard Evangelical) and @Putin (die-hard Orthodox) must PERSUADE @Pontifex (die-hard Catholic) to overturn Peter's 3X Denial, ASAP, by testifying in the Upper Room of Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, with the help of Ni-CODE-mus, a sMoL boy with the GOD CODE and with THE JESUS'S STRAND, ie, with the \"MagdaleneFrienDNA\" (Ferdinand Magellan) from Lazarus Islands. \n\n9.

    "text": "Trump‚Äôs so-called peace plan is, in fact, a plan for a complete genocide in slower motion than the one happening right now, i.e., a complete genocide done by the former colonial power (the British, Tony Blair for that matter). A true gesture for peace would be to break the blockade of Gaza maintained by the Israeli army. Netanyahu is Trump‚Äôs useful idiot and Zionist Jews are Zionist Christians‚Äô useful idiots. Trump like so many American evangelical Christians and white supremacists is anti-Semitic and Zionist. He wants to get rid of the Jews, but only after the Jews have exterminated the Muslims. For these Christians, non-Christians are all damned for the simple reason that they have all rejected the Savior (Jesus). Anyway, this peace plan for Palestine is a non-starter since Iran is now aligned with Russia and \"communist\" China. Blame W. Bush and Tony Blair's lies about weapons of mass destruction for the mess in the Middle East.  With their lies about weapons (WMD), they gave Iraq to Iran and blame Trump: with his sheer stupidity, he gave Iran, Yemen and Afghanistan to Russia and ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù China. The US and Israel are doomed!",

Abby runs a show where everyone is so eager to out-talk the other that by the end, you are more uninformed than you were before the show begun. That's why I have to watch Laura's show because her guests are courteous and allow each other to complete their arguments.  On Abby's show, someone could begin to make a really great point, but before they are able to bring it home, another person begins talking, so the audience ends up learning nothing.  She really needs to get that part of her show under control, otherwise the show will slowly sink and eventually go off-air.  Also, the constant interruption is simply uncouth behavior.  Her guests need to do better, and only Abby can enforce that.",

Thats not a secret.\n\nJared did this because he is making literal billions in the middle east. \nCrypto and free planes... Qatar and saudi Arabia.\nQatar have been given an airbase and the Saudis gave jared  2 billion dollars. Easily obtained facts.\n\nBut Trump was livid he didnt win the prize. \nBut Jared was happy as he can now do more business in the middle east. \nAnd as a Jew he doesnt have the business hurting escalating animosity the war was  causing.  \n\nThough both trump and Jared were making bank off weapon sales. And  now will make more money off peace.\n\nSo all of this is about business , money , power , greed and envy.\nTrump envied Obama and wants the prize.\nJared wants more money through increased business opportunities. \nThe oil rich middle east countries want  power and stability.\nNo one here cares about peace or the palastinians. \n\nThis matters because it use to be peace through diplomacy. \nDiplomacy leading to peace.\nThis was was illegal as was Americas role in it.\nBut now its peace through business backed up by ultra violence. \n\nIts violence and the threat of more violence which forced hamas and Israel to stop.  \nAnd that worked because the middle east power bases sadly runs on money and violence.\n\nThe problem is this makes people hate america leading to another 9/11.\nAnd we lose the moral authority which took over a hundred years to build. And thousands died for no reason  and most importantly the peace will not last if found on inequality, corruption , violence and threats. \n\nWhy isnt CNN talking about how much money this deal will make the trump and Kushner family?",

Trump is trying so hard to get a peace prize he would do anything now. Remember he's solved 7 or 8 wars since January. Lol, except the one he said would. Poor Ukraine they must feel betrayed today. Trump and the administration could also work harder on this shutdown. Blaming the left sounds so silly, they aren't in charge of anything.

People don't so much feel sorry for Gaza now like they may have before. Hamas hasn't lay down their weapons, nor have they release all the hostages. That's Trump and BB excuse not to give Gaza $hit. Which is why Hillary is squirming and keeps talking about it is a 20 point plan with more work to do. They ain't going to do nothing else honey. You can believe that. It is over.",

    "text": "We destroyed Iran's nuclear bomb making capabilities, neutralized Gaza as a threat, and got the live hostages back. We don't need to do anything further for Gaza or anyone else. Gaza is going to be very busy for a very long time rebuilding. BB and Trump have met their objectives and won. Ignore Gaza. Ignore Hillary's and the other globalists quest for a global Islamic State for Hamas. Ever wonder why Hillary and the other globalist are so keen on pushing the rest of the 20 point plan? Give them nothing. They are your enemy. Be weary. They did not release all the hostages, not did they lay down their weapons' seem to me that is full justification not to go forward with the rest of the 20 point plant that Hillary and the other Globalist so badly  want. Don't do it. If they want you to do it something is up.",

Biden I hope you recovered from your cancer and it looks like your mind is coming back, so are ready to face charges?   You know for showing favor in Federal Contracting..cough your son cough.  Biden, enjoy your retirement.  Im sorry, but you did not do a good job.  The Stars did not align.  Big Green and a failed recovery of the Disabled Stim Check and your dismissal of inflation and the cuts to inflationary raises to Social Security were not overlooked by the voters.  To put in honest terms, I noticed and felt apathy for those you left behind.  Angry remarks to questions about the disability check like covid is over, they dont need the money was remembered by me...those 400 dollars were a deposit for housing.  Without, I went homeless.  So yes, we did.  And that goes to show, never ever allow rental properties to augment rent during medical crisis again...freeze prices. That is directed to Trump.  Too many took advantage of govt programs, and then when the crisis was over...did not lower their rental rates.  It's a lesson...over looked during the Covid Crisis.  We are still waiting for those rental prices to come down, and some have...very slowly.   How is your son, Biden?  Hopefully, no more trips to Russia...I hope.  I know you miss the good one.  I know.  Much love and condolences on the loss of your other son.  Couple of things<  I know I sound like a natural athlete, but come on...Russia is not an ally.  And China isn't as well.  It goes to show, how unsafe both countries are to the families of our politicians and to the country as well.  Who started Covid?  Where did originate?  Who failed to control it's spread?  China. China caused all this, and a friendly reminder rewarding them with manufacturing contracts was not the correct decision in a healing economy.  Those jobs were needed here.  Russia will try anything to capture bad behavior and by it use it to manipulate and undermine our govt.  A Good Father to the American people and Devil himself to everyone else is of wisdom.  Never think anyone outside the US loves us, if they did they would begging to be part of the union, and I see no lines...so get the clue.",

Take a look at the black student in Mississippi who was found hanging from a tree, they wanted it to be a racial lynching so so bad. It was being covered up even though they have a black Police captain, a black coroner, etc. They even did an independent investigation and autopsy.  Claim they have evidence but yet to release any evidence while they constantly blow on that dog whistle. Wake up people",

Crypto and free planes... Qatar and saudi Arabia.\nQatar have been given an airbase and the Saudis gave jared  2 billion dollars.\n\nTrump was livid he didnt win the prize. Jared was happy as he can now do more business in the middle east. \nAnd as a Jew he doesnt have the business hurting escalating animosity the war was  causing.  Though both trump and Jared were making bank off weapon sales.\n\nSo all of this is about business and money and greed and envy.\nTrump envied Obama and wants the prize.\nJared wants more money through increased business opportunities. \nThe oil rich middle east countries want business and power and stability.\n\nThis matters because it use to be peace through diplomacy. Diplomacy leading to peace.\nThis was was illegal as was Americas role in it.\nBut now its peace through business backed up by ultra violence. \n\nIts violence and the threat of more violence which forced hamas and Israel to stop.  And that worked because the middle east sadly runs on money and violence.\n\nThe problem is this makes people hate america leading to another 9/11.\nAnd we lose the moral authority which took over a hundred years to build. And thousands died for no reason  and most importantly the peace will not last if found on inequality, corruption , violence and threats. \n\nWhy isnt CNN talking about how much money this deal will make the trump and Kushner family?",

The left wing coalition called for a ceasefire deal in the Biden era and they were ignored by him and totally vilified by the right wing, and now because Trump got sick of Netanyahu blowing up international relations and after he let him kill more Palestinians, removed the block on massive bunker busting bombs that were used to destroy tent communities and openly deliberated a deal to steal land from Palestinians there is this massive praise? American politics is so disgusting, the bar is so low now. Trump can destroy all our liberties and then change his mind a year later and people will praise him for doing the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing even tho he started the problem in the first place. His only saving grace was Joe Biden cared more about his fealty to Israel than his career, his vice president, his reputation and his country, he‚Äôs a disgrace and Trump is an opportunist. Today I‚Äôm happy these Palestinians no longer have to suffer, give them their state, free the other remaining 10k hostages in the israeli jails, including the children Israel keeps and tortures without charges and then we can talk about true progress.

I go to work everyday because it's my job. Should my employer praise me everyday for showing up? Trump is getting tons of praise from Democrats from world leaders he's having a great time he's happy he's proud of himself. Does he need more praise? Is that what really need?",

Those bunker busters that collapsed Nasrallah's hideout were Biden's gift. Israel managed to significantly damage hamas and south Lebanon before Trump took office. Thank you Biden for the vetos in UNGA, UN Security council and ICJ, favouring Israel. This peace came only because of a weakened enemy and a strong Israel.

I know it‚Äôs a little apples vs oranges, but still it‚Äôs got me thinking. \n\nPutting aside how the Accords legacy might be muddled because of the subsequent Gaza war, I often felt that Trump should have done a better job explaining exactly what his administration did to help get those Accords through. I‚Äôm still not sure to this day. \n\nPerhaps, back then, his m.o. was just to take all the credit, say it‚Äôs the greatest thing ever, maybe not even learn what his administration actually did, and leave it at that. And, some of his supporters in the 2020 election year would just ridiculously parrot ‚Äúdid you know there‚Äôs peace in the Middle East now?‚Äù  \n\nIn any case, this time his team is clearly trying to show the details, show him in command, and trying to build on the momentum. \n\nWe shall see what history shows regarding his administration‚Äôs role, the legacy of this ceasefire, and whether foreign policy success will help his ratings at home, but for now the PR seems to be working.",

    "text": "The Gaza ceasefire brokered by President Trump is a fragile and premature pause in conflict rather than a lasting peace. Experts widely agree that though the initial truce and hostage releases offer hope, key issues remain unresolved‚Äîmost critically, Hamas‚Äô commitment to disarmament and a permanent ceasefire. Netanyahu was reportedly skeptical about rushing the deal, and many analysts warn that Hamas, deeply entrenched in armed resistance, is unlikely to fully disarm voluntarily. The ceasefire‚Äôs second phase, depending on Hamas' full compliance‚Äîincluding releasing all hostages and ceasing hostilities‚Äîis yet to be fulfilled, and there are ongoing reports of violations and internal executions by Hamas of suspected collaborators. Given these complexities, the current lull carries significant risk of collapse and another round of intense conflict within weeks unless strong enforcement and international mediation persist.",

Crypto and free planes... Qatar and saudi Arabia.\nQatar have been given an airbase and the Saudis gave jared  2 billion dollars.\n\nTrump was livid he didnt win the prize. Jared was happy as he can now do more business in the middle east. \nAnd as a Jew he doesnt have the business hurting escalating animosity the war was  causing.  Though both trump and Jared were making bank off weapon sales.\n\nSo all of this is about business and money and greed and envy.\nTrump envied Obama and wants the prize.\nJared wants more money through increased business opportunities. \nThe oil rich middle east countries want business and power and stability.\n\nThis matters because it use to be peace through diplomacy. Diplomacy leading to peace.\nThis was was illegal as was Americas role in it.\nBut now its peace through business backed up by ultra violence. \n\nIts violence and the threat of more violence which forced hamas and Israel to stop.  And that worked because the middle east sadly runs on money and violence.\n\nThe problem is this makes people hate america leading to another 9/11.\nAnd we lose the moral authority which took over a hundred years to build. And thousands died for no reason  and most importantly the peace will not last if found on inequality, corruption , violence and threats. \n\nWhy isnt CNN talking about how much money this deal will make the trump and Kushner family?",

Monothestic religions and Communism were from their very beginning just excuses to justify crimes. Holy Wars are a concept of Christianity (with the Crusade) and Islam (with Dshihad and Intifada) no ancient polythestic religion has that to my knowledge and the radical left and communists have their own holy wars in form of their world revolution or whatever they call it (which ironically the person those radical leftists and communists claim to fight for suffer from most: the working class, the innocent citizens, the civilians, the truly poor and needy). The future is now and it frees mankind of both old and rather new ideologies that are merely excuses for crimes and slavery 2.0.",

    "text": "The United States was naive, believing the CCP's values ‚Äã‚Äãmirrored those of the democratic world. The United States still hasn't fully grasped the CCP's position. Since its founding, the CCP has stood in opposition to democracy. The CCP has also pragmatically viewed the United States as its enemy. The CCP has remained unchanged, but the United States simply believed it could change it. Unfortunately, its efforts have been in vain, empowering the CCP, which in turn has the power to bring down the United States. None of this can be blamed on the CCP. The only blame lies with the United States, which has brought harm to itself and democracy by underestimating its enemies and leaving behind the seeds of disaster.",

We working-class Brits knew by the late eighties that they ( our ruling class ) were messing with our food and water for reasons we know today. Unbelievable !! \r\nSo in the spring of 1995 the Fabian Society gave the instruction to treble the fluoride strength. America studied what effect British tap drinking water had on bullfrogs. \r\nThe results will shock you. So did the MSM publish the findings ???    Heck NO ! \r\nWell they all turned gay !   I rest my case.  Why, though ? \r\nWELL...It is all about total control. \r\nWorking-class people of Britain must destroy the Tory Party.  Never to exist ever again.\r\nCome to Britain and see weak, lazy, privileged, useless white men behave like little girls. They are everywhere !!!",

There is no peace; nothing is over. Hamas and several other groups in the region have already signed a declaration stating there will be no external rulers, and Hamas is merely using the ceasefire to regroup. So there is no peace at all.\n\nFurthermore, there are no world leaders actually signing anything meaningful. They were simply pressured by Trump to join a photo opportunity on a stage labeled ‚Äúpeace.‚Äù This again is the Trump show where he puts people in a glass box on a stage in the public eye, so that they have to support the vals narrative.\n\nIn reality, they are there only to sign trade and reconstruction deals, to get money if Trump‚Äôs group is allowed to redevelop Gaza. This will not happen.\n\nSo please stop spreading these ideas. It‚Äôs just a prisoner exchange. There were no legitimate representatives of Palestine present",

    "text": "The Bible verses that describe the Antichrist bringing a false peace are Daniel 8:25 and 1 Thessalonians 5:3. Daniel 8:25 states that the Antichrist will \"by peace shall destroy many,\" and 1 Thessalonians 5:3 says, \"For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them\". Other verses, like Daniel 9:27, describe him making a treaty or covenant with Israel, which he later breaks, marking the halfway point of a seven-year period. \nDaniel 8:25: \"And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand\". \n1 Thessalonians 5:3: \"For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape\". \nDaniel 9:27: This verse is often cited as evidence that the Antichrist will make a covenant with many for seven years, and in the middle of that week (at the three-and-a-half-year mark), he will break it.",

Thats not a secret.\n\nJared did this because he is making literal billions in the middle east. \nCrypto and free planes... Qatar and saudi Arabia.\nQatar have been given an airbase and the Saudis gave jared  2 billion dollars. Easily obtained facts.\n\nBut Trump was livid he didnt win the prize. \nBut Jared was happy as he can now do more business in the middle east. \nAnd as a Jew he doesnt have the business hurting escalating animosity the war was  causing.  \n\nThough both trump and Jared were making bank off weapon sales. And  now will make more money off peace.\n\nSo all of this is about business , money , power , greed and envy.\nTrump envied Obama and wants the prize.\nJared wants more money through increased business opportunities. \nThe oil rich middle east countries want  power and stability.\nNo one here cares about peace or the palastinians. \n\nThis matters because it use to be peace through diplomacy. \nDiplomacy leading to peace.\nThis was was illegal as was Americas role in it.\nBut now its peace through business backed up by ultra violence. \n\nIts violence and the threat of more violence which forced hamas and Israel to stop.  \nAnd that worked because the middle east power bases sadly runs on money and violence.\n\nThe problem is this makes people hate america leading to another 9/11.\nAnd we lose the moral authority which took over a hundred years to build. And thousands died for no reason  and most importantly the peace will not last if found on inequality, corruption , violence and threats. \n\nWhy isnt CNN talking about how much money this deal will make the trump and Kushner family?",

The intention of Hamas and many of its participants in Europe is to exterminate Israel if they had the strength. Fortunately, they don't. Israel does have the strength, but fortunately, not the intention. That's why there has been a population growth in Gaza in the past two years, something the Jews can't say about 1940-1945. \n\nThe hatred against the Jews is enormous",

Peace in the middle East ... seriously !!! where was Benjamin Netanyaha, the leaders of Hamas, Iran and all the other war Belligerents  involved in this conflict at this signing ceremony ???? \nI'm calling this what it is, kiss Trumps ass day. He got a cease fire and the release of the hostages (to be commended btw) but this wouldn't of happened if Netanyaha didn't fumble the ball and strike Qatar and upset Trump and his families nearly 1 billion Dollar investment pay day.\nThis conflict is far far far from  over , and unlike the Good Friday agreement that ended decades of violence in Northern Ireland which had representatives from the I.R.A. / U.D.A / I.N.LA / British and Irish Gov etc to end it, and involved years of disarmament.\nNot to mention a clear peace process, that included the release of prisoners, the entering into government by ex terrorists and banned political parties, the destruction of arms by paramilitary groups witnessed by an international body. Resolved issues relating to sovereignty, governance , discrimination , justice, policing, etc, this has nothing only Trumps very vague 20 point plan which will fall apart around point 3/4 !!!",

An you gain a knew nature to learn an do the lords will, by reading an learning the lords ways. The alternative to not accepting is the 7 year tribulation, gods judgement and trail of the left behind, hell on earth. 21 wraths are place on this earths. the 7 seals, the 7 trumpets, and the 7 vials/bowels (base on translation). Some will be know ones like oceans a rivers turning to red blood and the antichrist kingdom into darkness like pharaohs in exodus.

Yes Lucifer the evil one will rule for 7 years and force people rich an poor to worship him attack those who apose his rule even he will trick all to see he is the messiah. Jesus will return at the end of the 7 tribulation with us saints to put Lucifer into the pit and Jesus rule 1000 years. The non believer will be judge a your nam not on book of life, cast to lake of fire, aplace forever seperated from God and eternal torment.

Sounds like they're projecting to hear things they way they WANT to hear them.  Just like Trump has brainwashed them to do.  What, do you think they should light off fireworks?

What they do, not what they say! Today, in Africa and all around the World, thousands of Christians are being murdered by those who read and follow the Quran. The Quran is the holy book of Islam. There are 120 verses, surahs, encouraging war on Christians and Jews, rape, looting, pedophilia, human slavery, and murder! Now, many Muslims do not even read the Quran and many do not know this. They listen to their Clerics, but insist Islam is peaceful. Like those who use the Quran to justify murder and rape, they do not read the Quran. \r\nWhat is hard to understand is why the World News Stations keep supporting Islam when all the evidence is right before their eyes that Islam is the problem in this world. \r\nIslam is from Satan. You do not have to speculate about that, just look at what Muslims are doing, and have done, to the World for over 70 years. The reason they ignore the truth is that they also serve Satan. The World News services are run by sexual perverts who only care about their lifestyle, not saving lives.",

    "text": "This is how smart the American people are.    Why were hostages taken?    Israel illegally began settling in Gaza again.  The cycle was restarted by Net, the same one that led to International Human Rights violations.  Second step, are hostages.  Third step, resolution to create a false sense of peace not meant to be kept by Israel.  They will resettle in three months, new hostages in six.  If no hostages are taken, then by cycle means Israel will enter Gaza again.  So why are you dancing, fool?  Do you really think we are that naive?  You are supporting a war criminal state which means by proxy you may incur some of the War Crimes.  What kind of fool gives money to a Political Actor that commits genocides, various human rights violations including the assassination of children at the end of a sniper rifle. (videos can be found on youtube)?   You say you are brave and have courage...but only to do the wrong thing obviously. Israel has already hustled three figures of billions from this naive, and egotistical President.  A word of advice, Americans.  Do not go to Israel or Gaza, it's not safe. It will never be safe.  They won't allow it...meaning the American President and Israeli Leadership.  When that violence spills to America, will it be organic or manufactured to continue Trump's and Israel's policies.  We gain nothing by shipping money meant for the American needy from the poor to manufacturing industries that need capital to operate and/or survive. Americans and America first is lost in Trump's current policy and foreign diplomacy with Israel and Palestine both.   17 people or more or less does not warrant billions of dollars in aid.  That is the hard truth of math in our current American Economic State.  One wonders, you have to know.  My love is for America and Americans here.......I have little to no lover for parasitic Political Actors.  none whatsoever.  Check Mate Trump.",

What is happening now is the beginning of a new era and a great victory for the Palestinian people after they were extorted from most countries in the world the recognition of the State of Palestine on its land of 1967 as is found in international resolutions, the latest of which is the International Criminal Court, which did not recognize Israel‚Äôs borders now. The Palestinian people have the right to continue their honorable resistance in order to liberate the entire land of Palestine from the river to the sea. The Jews of the world must be convinced that the land of Palestine is not their land and leaving now is better for them before it is too late because generations carry on their backs what neither friend nor enemy would believe in order to avenge their fathers and mothers who fell drenched in their pure blood, the land of Palestine.",

    "text": "The following is a complete refutation of the accusations of genocide made in recent years.\n\nThe current death toll in the Gaza War is about three percent of the Gaza Strip‚Äôs population. [1] This is lower than the CIA estimate for the number of people who would‚Äôve been born in the area during the duration, as they assigned the area a population growth estimate of 2.02% in 2024. [2] This means that the people with Gazan heritage (both those who stayed and those who emigrated) may have had little to no real population decrease.\n\nTo put these casualty figures in a historical context, the UN estimates around 92% of Gaza‚Äôs residential buildings to have been damaged or destroyed. [3] This means that a war which has broken 92% of the homes over nearly two years has failed to kill 97% of the population in the same time frame. For comparison, the Atomic Heritage Foundation cites General Curtis LeMay as assuming 20% of North Korea‚Äôs population to have died in the Korean War, while CFR education says the same conflict destroyed 85% of North Korea‚Äôs buildings without making a breakdown between different types of buildings. [4][5] This means that while destroying or damaging a potentially higher share of Gaza‚Äôs buildings than UN forces destroyed of North Korea‚Äôs buildings, Israel has killed a far smaller share of Gaza‚Äôs population.\n\nFurthermore, Reuters notes that ‚ÄúThe Palestinian Health Ministry figures do not differentiate between civilians and Hamas combatants, who do not wear formal uniform or carry separate identification.‚Äù [1] This indicates that Hamas is not reasonably doing what it can to protect the people under its rule from succumbing to the conflict. In fact, it does the opposite, with a 2019 NATO report finding that it engages in the following activities:\n\n‚ÄúFiring rockets, artillery, and mortars from or in proximity to heavily populated civilian areas, often from or near facilities which should be protected according to the Geneva Convention (e.g. schools, hospitals, or mosques).\n\nLocating military or security-related infrastructures such as HQs, bases, armouries, access routes, lathes, or defensive positions within or in proximity to civilian areas.\n\nProtecting terrorists‚Äô houses and military facilities, or rescuing terrorists who were besieged or warned by the IDF.\n\nCombating the IDF from or in proximity to residential and commercial areas, including using civilians for intelligence gathering missions.‚Äù [6] Even with this, Hamas militants are still around a third of deaths in the Gaza Strip. [1]\n\nAs you can see, the low death rate, especially in relation to other wars or to Gaza‚Äôs own birth rate, coupled with Hamas‚Äôs practices in aggressing this war and doing the opposite of protecting its civilians during the course, proves the genocide accusations to be entirely false.\n\n[1] Al-Mughrabi, Nidal, and Emma Farge. ‚ÄúHow Many Palestinians Has Israel‚Äôs Gaza Offensive Killed?‚Äù¬†Reuters, 29 July 2025,¬†http://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-many-palestinians-has-israels-gaza-offensive-killed-2025-03-24/.\n\n[2]¬†Gaza Strip - the World Factbook.¬†http://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/gaza-strip.

    "text": "I‚Äôm sorry, this is simply more Neocon-Globalist claptrap;\n1. Israel continues to exist only because it receives lavish financial and military support from the United States government at the behest of a small but powerful American Plutocracy that is mostly, but not exclusively, Jewish. If Israel were to lose this support, it would quickly implode. Israel is fundamentally weak.\n\n2. Israel‚Äôs odious, repugnant, unapologetic, ostentatious, evil genocide and ethnic cleansing of women, children and the elderly as well as of doctors, journalists and relief workers has thoroughly alienated and repulsed the publics of the rest of the world. There is no public sympathy for Israel in the world anymore except for Jewish plutocrats.\n\n3. Iran never was a threat to Israel or the United States. Moreover, Iran is easily deterred by missiles from the US Navy and Air Force as well as Israeli nuclear weapons. Even if Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons, they would have to be used as a deterrent, and not offensively because retaliation for their offensive use would be overwhelmingly devastating and cataclysmic.\n\n4. It is the US Neocons and Deep State who want to use Israel as a proxy to gain control over the entire Middle East energy reserves who want war with Iran, not vice versa. It is the desire for Middle East hegemony by the United States and Great Britain that is driving this war. Israeli kvetching about ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù is a ‚ÄúMacGuffin.‚Äù\n\n5. China and Russia have major security and economic interests in northern Iran which they are not going to allow the United States to use to threaten and use as blackmail. China gets 30% of its oil from Iran, which is vital to its manufacturing economy. Moreover, northern Iran is a key nexus for China‚Äôs ‚ÄúBelt and Road Initiative‚Äù as well as Russia‚Äôs ‚ÄúNorth-South Corridor.‚Äù Peace and stability in Iran are essential for these important trade routes to function. For that reason, both Russia and China will never allow the Iranian government to fall, even if that means going to war with the United States.\n\n6. While the ‚ÄúTwo State Solution‚Äù is the correct and necessary prerequisite for long term peace and stability in Palestine, the Israeli people are dead set against it and will never allow it to succeed. The only way a ‚ÄúTwo state solution‚Äù could be implemented is via an armed occupation of Israel. Now, which country would be willing to pay the price in blood and treasure to do that?",

The One who can predict the future......has CONTROL of the future DESTINY of mankind = God Almighty:  All roads lead to Israel, God's chosen 'Covenant' people:  Israel is the 'clock'. Jerusalem is the 'hour' hand. \"The Temple Mount\" (where the 3rd Temple will be rebuilt....in near future) is the 'minute' hand.  Jesus stated in Matthew 24 and 25.....\"This 'generation' shall not pass until ALL these 'signs' of \"The-End-of-the-Age\" (NOT the end of the world.....but life as we have known, meant to be temporal will soon come to an end.....BEFORE CHRIST RETURNS!!!......to set up His \"Millennial Kingdom\".....in Jerusalem over His people....AND all nations) are fulfilled.  A 'generation' is 70-80 years according to the Bible.  The clock started ticking toward \"The-End-of-the-Age\".....when Israel became a nation (IN ONE DAY!.....just as predicted is Isaiah 66) on May 14, 1948.....the same day the British colonial mandate in Palestine expired....that was 77 years ago! This 2nd 'regathering' of the Jews, after being scattered for 1,900 years.....was predicted in Joel 3;  \"I will bring back my people....into their land.......and restore the fortunes of Judah (NOTE: Israel is SUPER-RICH; 32 cubic feet of natural gas off the Mediterranean, Trillions of dollars worth of chemicals in \"The Dead Sea\".....cont. finding of oil reserves.....).\" \"I will bring ALL nations into \"The Valley of Jehoshaphat = \"Yahweh judges\"......BECAUSE.....they have scattered MY PEOPLE......and DIVIDED....MY LAND (NOTE: Israel is THE ONLY NATION.....God Almighty founded.....AND deeded it specifically to His Chosen People, \"The Jews\".....as an everlasting covenant.  Just because they have been out of their land for 1,900 years......does NOT mean God's 'Covenant' ....is null and void:  The land includes Gaza Strip, Sinai Peninsula, West Bank......and beyond.....its current borders. IT IS GOD ALMIGHTY......THAT CONTROLS THE JEWS FUTURE DESTINY...AND OCCUPIED LAND.......NOT ANY OTHER AUTHORITY ON EARTH.....ESPECIALLY THE TERRORIST GROUPS LIKE HAMAS....AND HEZBOLLAH.....BOKO HARAM, ETC!!!!  THEY WILL NEVER....EVER....EVER.....ACCEPT A 2-STATE SOLUTION!......The 'Islamic World'......is waiting for the 'right' opportunity....to wipe Israel and the Jews......OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH!.....AND ANY OTHER COUNTRY THAT SUPPORTS ISRAEL.......NAMELY \"THE U.S.\"......they regard as \"The Greater SATAN\".  The FINAL prophecy to be fulfilled......IS....\"The Rapture\" of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4: 15-18) Greek word \"Harpadzo\" to 'snatch' away.  Christ will come for \"The Church\" as a thief in the night.....to ESCAPE God's FINAL WRATH/7-year-judgment....on the earth...against all of Israel's enemies.....and those who hate God and His Holy WORD.....\"The Holy Bible\":  That condemns Homosexuality-Sodomy (ANY 'unnatural' sex and affections) Abortion, murderers, esp. 'martyrs' like Charlie Kirk....(the Democrats......still celebrate his murder!) revilers (those who insult...and debase using profanity unjustly)....the lawless in general. Mark 13: 20; If God had NOT shortened the days (to 7 years) NO ONE would survive!  YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND!  Accept Christ as your Saviour.  He died on Calvary's cross to pay the 'penalty' of your sins. Ask Him for forgiveness. He will forgive you and give you eternal life.....Today is the day of salvation.....tomorrow may be too late...",

    "text": "Only an ignorant Israeli sycophant will claim Israel is the strongest in the ME. \nGiven all the massive NATO military assistance , Israel could not defeat a poorly armed group Hamas. While Israel needed a constant military resupply from its NATO big brothers, Hamas fought for 2 straight years without resupply. \n\n6 layers of the best western air defence systems were put over Israel\n --- THAAD + ARROW 3 + ARROW 2 +  David sling + Patriot ( In Jordan) + US naval ships air defence ---\nIran successfully penetrated all these 6 layer shields and destroyed all the selected targets in Israel, and remember, Iran is a country that has been under economic sanctions and arms embargo for more than 30 years. While Israel get billions of dollars largesse from its Westerns allies to buy whatever weapons it need, Iran had to develop its weapons domestically, still the best of the air defence systems from Israel and the West could not stop indigenous Iranian missiles.  \nSay whatever you like to say about Iran, the facts remains that Iran fought the 12 days war alone with no assistance from any 3rd parties (the so-called proxies did not participate, even the Houthis stopped firing missiles at Israel during the 12 days), on the other hand, Israel needed the assistance of US + Jordan + France + Germany to help intercept Iran missiles, so much for a superpower that ALWAYS need assistance of its allies to protect itself from a \"weakened\" enemy.\nIsrael needed to sneak into Iran to disable Iran air defence systems and carried out terrorist attacks against civilians to be able to create an illusion of victory, on the other hand Iran did not need to sneak into Israel to destroy selected targets. \nAll damages done by Israel in Iran were replicated by Iran in Israel,  example, Israel attacked 2 oil DEPOS in Iran, in retaliation, Iran struck and caused severe damage to Israel Oil refinery in Haifa, Israel immediately stopped attacking Iranian oil facilities, Iran also destroyed the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel  in retaliation for attack against Iran nuclear research facilities, Iran could have easily destroy DIMONA but chose not to maintain a consistence stance against attack on nuclear facilities. Israel had to resort to media censorship to cover up its losses against Iran.\n\nA so-called superpower that never accepts or respects ceasefire was forced to stop attacking Iran, you should ask yourself why would Israel stop attacking Iran if Iran is so weak? Israel is still bombing Gaza, Lebanon and Syria but stopped bombing a weak Iran, why?\nThe truth is Israel is an illusion of power. Israel only shines by fighting those that cannot fight back like the defenceless populations of Gaza or Lebanon or Syria. There is ZERO air defence in GAZA or Lebanon or Syria so Israel can just fly it Planes into those places and drop bombs on the civilians with no challenge. \nRaining down bombs on a defenceless population is not a military power, it is just cruelty but that is what monsters like Fareed celebrate as power. \n\nIsrael only relies on tricks and stunts to create illusion of victory, like a sabotage attack in Lebanon to disable Hezbollah fighters before the war starts or a sabotage attack in Iran to disable the IRGC before the war start. Israel is like that boxer that needs to drug his opponents before getting into the ring with them. \nPay attention to the fact all the so-called Israel enemies  are under some severe economic sanctions and arms embargo imposed on them by Israel western allies to weaken them just to give Israel a upper hand. IRAN, Syria, Lebanon and Gaza are all under western imposed economic and military restrictions so that Israel can have supremacy. A so-called superpower that needs it allies to tilt the field in its favour. Remove the economic and military embargo on Hamas or Hezbollah and see how quickly the illusion of Israel military might will collapse.\n\nAnyone that thinks Israel is stronger than Turkey or Egypt or Iran is completely naive, Israel is not the strongest arm force in the region contrary to Netayanhu a**-lickers like Fareed. \nThe one-sided destruction freedom that Israel enjoys against the armless, improvished Palestinians is why it could do what it is doing in Gaza, but It will be a mutual destruction assurance against major military forces in the region. Tel Aviv will be long gone before Tehran or Ankara or Cairo look like Gaza.",

    "text": "I would love to know more about the driving forces behind this deal. Here is my take:\n\n- Israel has risen to the incontestable premier military force in the region. The October Hamas atrocities have pushed Israel over the edge. In the first, say 14 or so months of their Gaza campaign the IDF have masterfully reduced the operational capacity of Hamas to near-zero. Hamas was aware of this.\n- In the final 4 months of the campaign Israel was beginning to look unhinged, less focussed strategically, and more erratic, to the point that accusations of genocide were starting to look more believable than in the initial months. A culmination point was the attack on Qatar, an independent sovereign state with no direct involvement in the conflict.\n- Trump‚Äôs threat to support Israel unconditionally if Hamas did not surrender, seen together with Israel‚Äôs increasing radicalisation, sent alarm signals to Qatar and Saudi Arabia, who started putting pressure on Hamas lest the conflict would finally broaden to the wider Middle East\n- Details of the plan look to be taken directly out of the blueprint of Tony Blair‚Äôs Good Friday agreement. \n\nSo, probably as an over-simplification, Trump was the brawn, Blair the brain. It took not just force to get Hamas to agree, but the threat of an unpredictable US president who cannot justifiably be seen as rational to get this over the line. The question is now whether this mix of drivers is suitable for the next phase. The next phase must be constructive, rather than destructive. As long as Trump does not have the peace prize, he still has skin in the game, he still is motivated to act. But as it is just brawn he brings to the table, I have no confidence that the next phase can be more than all the other phases we have seen since 1948. Sustainable peace can only happen if the Palestinians have a state of their own, and they cannot have that until Israel withdraws from the West Bank, and the Palestinians give up on the right of return. These are incisive compromises both parties have to make. As they will not be made, even this breakthrough is likely to usher in merely the next period of uneasy peace, and then things will explode again.",

    "text": "The analysis is empty because, as it has always been with 2 state solution, you are putting a carriage in front of the horse. If the acceptance of  2 state solution dominated among Palestinian Arabs, it could be implemented in 1948, in 2000, under the current Abbas Palestinian administration ( which was thrown away from Gaza by Hamas in 2007 after Israeli unilateral withdrawal but acted as if it controlled Gaza and the nest of terror and savage power in this enclave did not exist).  It set unrealistic conditions for Israel instead. Do you know any precedent in human history that the side of the military conflict which started the war and lost in the battlefield completely - puts preconditions for peace treaty? But that was exactly lifetime terrorist Abbas did and was unfortunately encouraged to do by many world parties. The global call for ‚Äúfree Palestine from the river to the sea‚Äù today is an obvious call for one state, not for two state solution. For everyone who has eyes, ears and mind and not a complete hypocrite. \n\nIsrael never annexed the whole West Bank and Gaza for only one reason: although it cannot completely withdraw from the territories which  it controls as a result of the 75 year war which not Israel started, it cannot rule these territories for one reason: opposite to  widespread deception it is not an apartheid state and has never been.  Druse, Bedouin and Circassian soldiers fight side by side with Jewish soldiers for their homeland and for its peace and security.  Palestinian Arabs are also not forbidden to do that, they have all civil rights even without civil responsibilities.   On the other hand, every Jew who dares to live in the old city of Jerusalem or near the holy site in Hebron is an occupant for deserves to be killed.  That is the official position of Ramallah government, it would pay reward to killer‚Äôs family. Incitement, real fascist propaganda content never disappeared in the textbooks.  Textbooks and teachers teaching fascism, raising generations of people ready to commit October 7 or ignoring it (the best scenario) are paid by the UN.   Macron and Starmer embrace Abbas as a respected leader of the sovereign country with no concerns.  \n\nGermany could regain statehood in  3 years after WWll because there was already Adenauer and already no Hitler.  In order to be an independent state, Arab Palestinians need to have their Adenauer, not Abbas and not any other terrorist ( they are never ex, there is no expiration time for Munich 1972).  The only practical and humane solution for Arab Palestinians today is external international rule.  You are speaking of futurism (remember how many years German children were taught fascism- 12 years, not for generations).  You are missing the only practical solution for today",

    "text": "As an Armenian-American with half of my family members from Lebanon, I have a story I would like to share here. The decades-long conflict has and continues to affect Lebanon; my father, aunt, and grandparents all experienced and saw the country change because of it. In Beirut, they lived near the Palestinian refugee camps, which were originally populated by Armenians fleeing the 1915 Genocide. The majority of the Palestinians in Lebanon originate from the towns and villages in present-day Israel that were depopulated as a result of the 1947-1949 Palestine war, aka Nakba, and their presence in Lebanon would serve as one of the contributing factors to the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1991). My grandmother (died in 2021), who was 20 in 1948 when Israel was established, said that once that happened, the country changed completely. Also, when she was home alone, gunmen from those camps showed up at her front door with the intent to kill her, and despite her being able to tell them that she meant no harm, she never recovered from that experience. I want the conflict to end with the two-state solution to finally become a reality, which is an Israeli and Palestinian State living side-by-side in peace, and all of the settlements in the West Bank will need to be evacuated, with them either disbanded or repopulated with Palestinians who were displaced.",

The Jews and the other 12 tribes of Israel were black and scattered during slavery. This is part of the reason aside sin that judgement is coming to America and those nations complicit in Transatlantic Slavery. The Deuteronomy curses do not fit modern created state of Israel which should be a sign for the nations for who Israel is READ!!! Yahshua is King!!",

Vomit ü§Æ The most dangerous modern Autocracy and dictator (Donald)  to be acting as if he brokered this BS. It's lunacy. There will be no Palestinian state per Isreal. And Qatari supported Hamas will continue their terror on Jews and Israel. Just as U.S. and Germany and Israel, and Russia and Saudi and China and N Korea, and all arms selling countries do, as they all sponsor and support war global war machines and Destruction and occupation of the chosen\n\"Undesirables\" and chosen \"enemies\".  Now each of these real life flesh and blood villains are \"brokering\" entities along with and oligarchies and religious financially supported destructions.  Now, Billions made as they all take a piece of the pie in the \"rebuilding\" bullsh*t on the backs of death, torture, and obliteration of ethnic and cultural cleansing, and even \"biblical\" histories wiped out' Men of war - should sicken our hearts and minds and stomach. Don't buy this myth! Never forget Hamas and Israel and Russia and U.S. and Saudi  and Germany and England and China and N Korea hv set THE Equation  - any country with enough money and religious financial & ideological power, and military support and greed for land and riches can illegally destroy ethnic groups and countries for profit and resources! Even India, with its cultural ancient history of peace and sharing and compassion  has destroyed and occupied the people and lands of most the chosen  \"undesirable\" in the eyes of the leaders throughout history!   That is the truth!  Humans are not seen as worth preserving.  Culture and history of humans is not worth preserving.  U, me any one of us - who, will be the next chosen \"undesirable\" people, are u next? That is the truth that must be remembered! A release of victims today, while a wonderful thing as it should hv never been needed,  does not erase the horrific torture, captivity, and obliteration of peoples and countries and cultures by these hateful self righteous, indignant,  parasitic megalomaniacs and oligarchies, royalty and religious global finacial powers that support them in their destruction of life and occupation of lands and resources. This \"cease fire\" and release of prisoners that was \"brokered\" is a basic move to distract the world. Love on- and rebuild\" after they destroy and demolish, kill and torture! It is lunacy and myth building and lies! Remember that! Or, we can not stop them! A leader like Donald who wants to demolish UN is not a peace keeper! Keep in mind UNESCO is an arm of United Nations (UN)  with the aim of promoting world peace and security through international cooperation in education, arts, sciences and culture. So U.S. current administration and Donald want to abolish UN. So really, what peace does he want? No peace! Only a piece of the finacial pie he will get for he and his global partners (leaders and institutions) when rebuilding Gaza and any other destroyed country they can occupy and extract resources from! Sadly they don't seeing the door to include the preservation of Humans! Shameful and vomit worthy! And should be stopped by anyone with money and position and power to do so, now!",

Did you notice that the \"Iron Dome\" isn't impenetrable?  You didn't mention that Israel did not defeat the Houthis, a truly rag tag military group that has pushed American Carriers out of the Red Sea.  We lost F18s because carriers had to evade Houthi missiles.  This is a big deal.  You waxed poetically about Israel's attack on Iran that was illegal accomplished with the help of American deception.  The Iranian response you left out completely.  That it penetrated the Iron Dome and wiped out a lot of strategic assets while not killing thousands of civilians is indeed remarkable.  Iran often warned Israel that it should move its citizens to bomb shelters prior to a volley.\n     You notice that Arab countries are buying Chinese weaponry and trading with China?  As BRICS comes into play US sanctions and other extortive measures are weakened.  You haven't reported on the Lancet Report that shows we kill around 560,000 souls every year with our sanctions.  \n     You also waxed on Iran, how its citizens lived in misery.  You don't mention how much worse it was when the US installed the Shah of Iran a cruel Monarch to replace a democratically elected president.   Women in Iran wore western dress, could work, drive and go to school.  The entire middle east would have become democratic but that's never been our interest no matter how often our media and politicians claim this.\n     Today there are more women in university than men.   The work in hypersonics that is done in Iran, Russia and China have likely saved the world.   George Bush left the ABM Treaty because it deters a first strike.   So\nwe then spent likely trillions on ABMs and developed systems that could intercept Ballistic Missiles pretty well.   However hypersonics gets around this.   Not that ABMs can't address this, you have to deploy hundreds of thousands systems.  So we will be putting our \"First Strike\" Plans on the shelf for now.   Iran has exercised loads of restraint however they know Israel will execute a Nuclear Strike soon.   Netanyahu has threatened this already and Donald Trump sat on his thumb.   Israel is carrying out attack in Gaza still, they never had intentions of following the Cease Fire.\n       If you want I can have a middle schooler write your next article.  Do better!",

In two years you'll see another round of rockets from Gaza to Israel, and we'll respond again. \nOnly the Palestinians can break this cycle, and even now that Hamas is weak the moderate people didn't try to throw them away.

Let no one be fooled anymore that you can solve any problem by arguing with them or giving them more space/help. It's a supremacist ideology which can't coexist with anyone else.

Fortunately, at this crucial time in its history Israel has an experienced leader like Netanyahu to lead the nation & secure Israel. \nIf Hamas is let off this time, new incarnation of Hamas with much more lethal weapons will rise in future making the present barbaric attack & hostage taking look a pedestrian affair. Israel may also lose air superiority advantage next time. \nThe West Bank is like a fist into the body of Israel in the map & if any future incarnation of Hamas occupies it & launches Oct-7 type attacks from there, it will jeopardize the very existence of Israel. \nVacating Gaza in 2005 by shifting Jewish townships & trusting PA leadership was a mistake. Denouncing Oslo Agreements & refusing to recognize Israel‚Äôs existence, Hamas executed PA opponents & took control of Gaza in 2007. Similar thing can happen in future to the West Bank. The stark choice for Israel is now or never. \nIt is now a struggle for survival of Israel. It is the anti-Jewish religious indoctrination from infant age that generates constant crop of terrorists. De-radicalization of that ideology requires Israel to continuous control & supervision of all Palestinian territories for several decades. It is difficult task but achievable else it will be too late. \nAl Taqiyya: Deceiving the infidels for the good of Islam is considered a virtue in Islam. The US was deceived & OBL was hidden because of this virtue.\nThe WW2 victorious Winston Churchill said: ‚ÄúIf you will not fight for right when you can easily win without bloodshed; if you will not fight when your victory is sure and not too costly; you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival\".",

Instead of an ideology that focuses on annihilating Israel, the education should focus on modernizing the population to reach civility and co-existence with Israel.    Until then, the Palestinian state, if coming true prematurely, will still be a pariah state that has mostly militant and uneducated population and requires outside assistance but not productive citizens that can take care of itself!  I find the two-state solution in the short-term is way too simple-minded!  I actually find Trump's solution of converting Gaza into a vacation destination to be promising in the short term because the beach nearby is indeed beautiful and tourism will help stabilize both the economy and security quickly!  Building tourist hotels doesn't require that much because the ruins/demolition sites can hire local human power and that will turn into incomes for them if the gulf nations provide the funding.  This is indeed an opportunity for making a living or even riches for the Gaza residents!",

    "text": "This deal will collapse before the end of the year, and again because of who was in that room.  The transaction was between old men who have a vested interest in preserving their status as heads of their respective factions, regardless of ideological considerations at this point:  the Palestinians are in an existential crisis of daily bombardment, Netanyahu has to at some point look like he's willing to deal in some way to get hostages or end the bloodshed or else face an inevitable Vietnam-style \"malaise\" at home.  The people waiting in the wings behind Netanyahu, and especially Hamas, did not agree to these terms - and there is no guarantee of how long the respective leaders can maintain discipline amongst their followers.\n\nFor that matter, spare a thought for the representatives of roughly half of the Palestinians - Fatah - who represent the West Bank.  They weren't at the table, and they sure as heck didn't agree to anything.  Did Hamas just trade away concessions to Israel that Fatah isn't comfortable with?  These are the problems you have when the \"state\" you have constructed on paper is a fiction; not truly self-governing or sovereign.  Just a convenient invasion target for your troops when you want to \"Get 'Em Back\", because it sounds better than what you'd really be doing - which is rolling tanks into something between a Native Reservation or an enforced Ghetto.\n\nAnd even if it does hold, and let's say for the moment that the bright shining future that everyone supposedly wants comes to pass.  In ten years, if there is a truly sovereign and self-governing Arab Palestine State bordering Israel, do you REALLY think the Israelis will let them have a standing army?  Secure their own borders?  Allow or disallow arms trade across their frontiers?  Pull the other one.  Israel will never allow an independent Palestinian state to exist.",

In Israel, Netanyahu and the Likud are still in power, and they are not pacifists. In Gaza, Hamas needed a breather, but they are still there too, and they show no real willingness to give way either. As for their disarmament, that is wishful thinking. So, peace or a resumption of hostilities? IF moderates come to power in Gaza and Jerusalem... IF the respective allies of the two camps apply enough pressure to calm things down (and they give themselves the means to do so)... IF hatred does not prevail over reason... time will tell. And then there's the matter of Gaza, but what about the West Bank, the sometimes violent encroachment of its territory by extremist settlers with the at least passive complicity of Netanyahu? That's not going to ease relations between the two peoples. In short, for the moment it's far too early to talk about peace.",

And  now will make more money off peace.\n\nSo all of this is about business , money , power , greed and envy.\nTrump envied Obama and wants the prize.\nJared wants more money through increased business opportunities. \nThe oil rich middle east countries want  power and stability.\nNo one here cares about peace or the palastinians. \n\nThis matters because it use to be peace through diplomacy. \nDiplomacy leading to peace.\nThis was was illegal as was Americas role in it.\nBut now its peace through business backed up by ultra violence. \n\nIts violence and the threat of more violence which forced hamas and Israel to stop.  \nAnd that worked because the middle east power bases sadly runs on money and violence.\n\nThe problem is this makes people hate america leading to another 9/11.\nAnd we lose the moral authority which took over a hundred years to build. And thousands died for no reason  and most importantly the peace will not last if found on inequality, corruption , violence and threats. \n\nWhy isnt CNN talking about how much money this deal will make the trump and Kushner family?",

    "text": "How‚Äôs it possible this guy is probably quite intellectual and a potential mayor and believes Hamas victim propaganda that it‚Äôs a genocide. First ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù that‚Äôs ever occurred when the enemy drops leaflets and sends messages to provide evacuation zones, feeds them, commits a ratio of 2:1 terrorist to civilian, first genocide when 3% of the population have died including Hamas and civilians so based off the ratio about 1% (yes any civilian death is horrible, the idf does operations based off this), first genocide when the government wants to maximise civilian deaths to establish a narrative to make them a organisation who in their charter wants the destruction of Israel and Jews worldwide, a organisation in which their kindy grad is kids holding guns standing on the Israeli flag, yeah their successful narrative makes them look humane. This is the first genocide in which neighbouring countries such as Egypt hasn‚Äôt let them in, they view them as extremists, they danced on the roof tops during 9/11 and paraded in the street after Oct 7. Ironically in most of the Middle East pro Palestine/pro Hamas rallies are banned. First genocide I have seen when countries of the same religion haven‚Äôt come together to stop the genocide. This is the first genocide in which the loosing side the one portrayed as the hopeless victim took 251 hostages and have 20 alive after two years. Ironically a hostage monologue after he was rescued said that they wanted Kamala to win, but once trump one, the cursing stopped, the food increased; they were frightened, trump doesn‚Äôt negotiate with terrorists they knew the hostages would be freed and they need to look in good shape for their sake. This is the first genocide I have seen when the more powerful side values life and the weaker values death. In 2021 Israel traded 1 solider for 1000 Palestine prisoners held in prison who are actual terrorists, but Hamas preys on Israel‚Äôs value to safe lives. During 2021 in the exchange the mastermind of Oct 7 was released but jn the same year he was suffering from a brain Tuma. Israel performed live saving surgery saving him; look how he repayed them. This guy is twice my age and yet is running to be a mayor in one of the biggest cities in the world. This shows that wars that have grey areas such as being pro Palestine and anti Israel but Hamas is a grey area CANT talk about them. These grey areas show how naive many are and when wars, everyone can agree on Russia (who supports Hamas) Ukraine, but wars like Israel Hamas require the next step of intelligent thinking and some don‚Äôt have as they desire the destruction of Israel (chanting intifada - terrorist uprising) or just want a purpose to protest with very very limited knowledge.",

Caitlin's a propagandist. and this guy's a raging communist. anybody in New York who votes for him has given up their nation and they are unpatriotic.pretty sick that Muslims attack New York in the greatest terrorist attack on American soil, over 3,000 Americans have died because of that attack, Muslims have an eternal perspective of hate against the west, and yet New Yorkers are considering voting for a man that has the ideology of the people that terrorized and attacked america. I can't even believe that people have forgotten and they would actually give up their country like this. especially in New York",

The long occupation and land seizures can‚Äôt be forgotten and glossed over. Settlers and their  unceasing land grab needs to be addressed.  Lasting peace is built on justice rooted in acknowledgment of the seeds of discontent.  Truth and reconciliation or even toleration demands it.  I‚Äôm hopeful it‚Äôs a lasting peace but not if the Palestinians must take the knee and cede more land and dignity. When we look at the endless racial animus in the United States, it goes back to the fact that Black people in this country,  after having been brutalize through slavers snd Jim Crow, have never received any apology or reparations from the United States government. And for the cynics, reparations don‚Äôt necessarily mean cash payouts, though that is also vital.  Since Israel is so largely modeled upon an American framework, I hope they will have the courage to take that extra step of reparation that the US did not.  If Germany can do it, so can Israel, given the  total decimation of Gaza.",

However I cannot support Netanyahu or his government, they will do everything to ensure the cease fire fails, a cease fire he never wanted. He will be pushing the settlers to move in and kick palestinian families out, he will be provoking Hamas to act which will always happen and I will never support Hamas in any way but Netanyahu is no longer defending Israel, he has along with his government become the same Nazi group of the 1940's that tried to wipe out all peoples of the Jewish faith. Netanyahu should at least be honest and not call it annexation, defence etc, call it by what it is, Israel's version of The Final Solution.",
